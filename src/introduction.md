## About this project

When I was a complete beginner learning web development, I felt that a lot of resources also assumed some basic knowledge I just didn't have (and didn't even know how to search for). There were so many references to things I didn't understand, which left me feeling stuck and frustrated to the point of quitting many times.

Looking back, it's clearer to me why this was happening. Tutorials often completely gloss over fundamental information, whereas more abstract courses can feel detached from real-world application. Many blog posts don't differentiate fact and opinion. There's just an overwhelming amount of information available in general that it's hard to know where to start.

This project is an attempt at bridging that gap. It's a guide for regular people - who might use technology day-to-day but have no idea how it works - to understand and apply the foundations of web development. Here are the main principles:

- Try to use everyday language to describe concepts & terms
- Only use technical terms once they've been sufficiently explained
- Always try to differentiate facts vs. opinions and requirements vs. preferences.
- Dig deep into details; don't omit things for convenience
- Provide immediately applicable examples and project ideas

If you have any questions or feedback about the content, or would just like to follow along with the progress, [join my Discord server](https://discord.gg/phpkY4NaY7). There's a channel called `#web-dev-zero` specifically for this project.

I'd especially appreciate feedback about:

- sections that are confusing (or particularly clear)
- information that seems to be missing or inaccurate
- parts that are boring (or particularly interesting)

## About the author

Hi, I'm Christine! Friends also call me Cha. Today, I serve as an Engineering Manager at [Clubhouse](https://www.clubhouse.io) after some years of being a full-time software engineer (specializing on the frontend).

I never intended on becoming a programmer. In 2015, I figured I'd be a more effective web designer if I actually understood how the things I was designing were built. So I started poking around online and teaching myself some basics.

About 9 months later, without any formal classes or certifications (and no college degree), I secured my first full-time role as a software engineer at Squarespace.

## About my journey

The main questions I usually get are 1) how to learn and 2) how to do it so quickly.

This project is my attempt at answering these. But first, we should recognize a lot of privilege that even allowed me the opportunity:

1. **Plenty of time.** I had recently quit full-time work and was freelancing to make ends meet. My hours were flexible, and I had no dependents. Being young, healthy, and very motivated, I probably averaged 5+ hours a day, 7 days a week, of active learning during those 9 months. Especially in the last few months, I often started coding in the morning and was still typing on the train ride home at 3am.
2. **Enough financial resources.** To maintain this intensity, I was only taking the minimum amount of freelance work. During the last three months, I received a $6k grant from the Recurse Center to support my growth. Between these income streams and my nearly-maxed credit card (plus no dependents, no large medical bills, etc.), I was able to afford not having full-time work.
3. **A strong support network.** I've always had immense encouragement from my family and friends. Mental health is one of the greatest yet most under-appreciated privileges, and it's especially critical in uncertain times. I was also lucky enough to join the Recurse Center for 3 months, which provided me with an excellent community of peers.

As much as specific learning methods and individual efforts can help, reality often has more to do with existing circumstances than anything else. Each journey is different; be compassionate with yourself.
