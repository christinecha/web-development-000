    <p>This guide is intended to help you get started in your web development journey.</p>

      <h1 id="00">00: Introduction to HTML</h1>
      <p></p>
    
        <h2 id=000>000: Your First Website</h2>
        <p></p>
        <br />
        <h2 id="whatisawebsite">What is a website?</h2>
<p>A website is the stuff that renders in your web browser. When you open up Chrome, or Firefox, or Netscape Navigator, what you see inside the frame is a website.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: point to the inner frame of a web browser</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="howdoesmycomputerknowwhatstufftoshow">How does my computer know what stuff to show?</h2>
<p>When you go to a web address, it's kind of like making a phone call. You direct your request towards a unique web address (ex. www.duckduckgo.com), just like your call requests a specific phone number. The internet companies involved then do a bunch of work to make sure you see the right website, just like the phone companies do to get your call to the right person.</p>
<p>You could go further to say that seeing the website is like hearing a voicemail. Someone somewhere uploaded an audio file, and that same file gets played to you every time you call. Except in the case of a website, instead of just an audio file, it's usually a combination of a whole bunch of different files.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: process of requesting &amp; receiving website? maybe in parallel with the phone call process?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try downloading this file - <a href="./00/cat.txt">cat.txt</a> - and opening in your browser! You can do this by just manually entering the file's address into your browser, i.e. <code>file:///Users/cha/Desktop/cat.txt</code> instead of where you'd normally write <code>http://www.google.com</code>.</p>
<p><img src="./00/local-url.png" alt="Using a local filepath in your browser" /></p>
<p>If you're not sure what this address would be, don't worry! You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>find the file in your computer's file viewer (ex. Windows Explorer or Mac Finder), right click, and "Open With" the browser of your choice.</li>
<li>or open your browser first, and select the file from there. Ex. in Chrome, you'd need to go to File &gt; Open File.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./00/local-url-open.png" alt="Viewing a local file in your browser" /></p>
<p>Oh hey, look at you! In essence, this is all a website is - files opened in a browser. In this case, it's just a plain text file. You can edit this file now on your computer, ex. in TextEdit or Notepad. Write whatever you want in there, hit Save, and refresh your browser - you should see it update to your recent changes.</p>
<p>Congratulations, that's your first website!</p>
<h2 id="whatiscode">What is code?</h2>
<p>Your file right now is just a plaintext* file. You can tell by the <code>.txt</code> extension at the end.</p>
<p>*<em><code>PlainText</code> is actually the technical term here for the file type, not just a descriptive phrase!</em></p>
<p>Other file types (<code>.html</code>, <code>.js</code>, etc.) contain <strong>code</strong>.</p>
<p>Code is just a set of instructions humans can write for machines to read. Code files also just contain text, but each type has different and very particular rules.</p>
<p>Technically, you can write code on any program* on your computer that lets you write text, like TextEdit or Notepad, as long as you can save the file with the correct extension.</p>
<p><em>*Programs like Microsoft Word save a bunch of other data with your text - formatting, preferences, and other data - which is why they use their own specific <code>.doc</code> or <code>.docx</code> extension on these files. If you open one of these in TextEdit, you'll see a bunch of wacky symbols and whatnot; clearly not human-readable text.</em></p>
<h2 id="howcanamachinereadmyhumaninstructions">How can a machine read my human instructions?</h2>
<p>Think of it like a massive chain of translations. A machine on its own has no understanding of your textual instructions. The ony thing that affects a hunk of metal is whether electricity is flowing (often presented by 1) or not (0). That's where all the memes about hackers using binary (01010111010110100010100101) come from; at the end of the day, that sequence is all the machines understand.</p>
<p>At some point, some human was like, what if we group these signals into unique patterns? 01000001 = A, 01000010 = B, so on and so forth. (These are the real patterns, by the way!)</p>
<p>That way, instead of having to write "010000010100001001000011" every time, you could just write "ABC" and automate the translation - way easier. And then we kept repeating this process.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: like the game of telephone, we're passing a message through multiple layers of translators</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a programming language, then, is just one of these "translation layers". In technical terms, the closer you get to the 0's and 1's side, the "lower level" the language is. A higher level language is more layers away, so it usually feels easier for humans to read and write.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: https://mrgcoding.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/language-spectrum.png maybe some robots/machines at one end &amp; people at the other?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when you learn JavaScript, one of the higher level languages, you can write something as simple and human-legible as <code>var x = 9</code> (setting a variable X to the value 9). It feels almost like magic that the computer can "understand" you, but it's just layers and layers of work from engineers past that you can now build on top of.</p>
<h2 id="whereandhowdoiwritecode">Where and how do I write code?</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, you can technically use any program as long as it can output plain text, like TextEdit or Notepad.</p>
<p>However, it might be useful for you to install a text editing application that is meant specifically for programmers, usually called a "text editor" or "I.D.E." ("Integrated Development Environment"). Most of these programs are free so you can always just download one and replace it later to your preferences.</p>
<p>Here are some free options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a></li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
</ul>
      
        <h2 id=001>001: Introduction to HTML</h2>
        <p></p>
        <br />
        <h2 id="creatinganhtmlfile">Creating an HTML file</h2>
<p>So far, we've only used a plain text file (<code>.txt</code>). Now, let's make our first HTML file.</p>
<p>You can either create a new file or just rename the existing file from <code>cat.txt</code> to <code>cat.html</code> to get started. Open it up in your text editor, and let's write some HTML!</p>
<h2 id="howtowritehtml">How to write HTML</h2>
<p>The rules of a specific language, a.k.a. "syntax" is just like grammatical syntax in English. The predefined set of rules and structure is what makes any language actually usable. Grammar, spelling, sentence structure, part of speech, punctuation, on and on. Code has similar rules!</p>
<p>The best part is, code doesn't have those nasty exceptions like in English ("though through tough thorough trough??") that you just have to memorize. There is a set of rules, and we have to stick to them exactly because the machines won't understand them otherwise.</p>
<p>In HTML, things are broken down into elements. (You might also hear them called "blocks" or "tags".) Each HTML element looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>[STARTING TAG] [INSIDE CONTENT] [CLOSING TAG]
&lt;element&gt;  some text might go in between  &lt;/element&gt;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: HTML structure as written above</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each element is indicated by a pair of two tags. Each is surrounded by brackets <code>&lt;whatever&gt;</code> but only the second has the slash <code>&lt;/whatever&gt;</code> so you know where it ends. In some cases, you can use a single tag, called a self closing tag, when it doesn't have any inside content, like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;/whatever&gt;

^ is just shorthand for
&lt;whatever&gt;&lt;/whatever&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The spacing doesn't usually* matter, like these would all be the same thing as the first example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;element&gt;
blah blah text content&lt;/element&gt;

&lt;element&gt;
  blah blah text content
&lt;/element&gt;

              &lt;element&gt;
      blah blah text content
          &lt;/element&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>*Spaces inside of an element can be a little confusing sometimes, but that's not important right now.</p>
<p>You'll see folks on the internet muttering a lot about "indentation". They're talking about how when you write the insides of an element, you indicate this by indenting in a bit. This makes reading code a bit easier sometimes because you can put elements inside of elements, infinitely:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;first&gt;
  some text

  &lt;second&gt;
    some text
    &lt;third&gt;
      &lt;fourth&gt;
        ... infinity ...
      &lt;/fourth&gt;
      some text
    &lt;/third&gt;
  &lt;/second&gt;
&lt;/first&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that without indentation, that looks like this, which makes it harder to tell where the starting/closing tags are.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;first&gt;
some text
&lt;second&gt;
some text
&lt;third&gt;
&lt;fourth&gt;
... infinity ...
&lt;/fourth&gt;
some text
&lt;/third&gt;
&lt;/second&gt;
&lt;/first&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>But it's important to remember - the choice to indent HTML is an opinion. It's a commonly held opinion (and a lot of people will enforce this opinion when you collaborate with them) but it's purely stylistic, and doesn't actually affect the meaning of the code.</p>
<h2 id="htmlelements">HTML Elements</h2>
<p>So what goes inside the tags? The technical answer is, anything you want - as long as it doesn't have spaces, and it's identical between the opening and closing tags. You could do something like this, and it's totally valid HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;my-beautiful-title&gt;My Title&lt;/my-beautiful-title&gt;
&lt;HappyText&gt;Happy happy&lt;/HappyText&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You'd essentially be defining your own custom elements, here called <code>my-beautiful-title</code> and <code>HappyText</code>.</p>
<p>However, to help you out, there's a huge existing selection of element types that all the browsers have agreed on. Here's just a few examples:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt; - H1, meaning Heading 1. For your very important, very large text.
&lt;p&gt;  - P, meaning Paragraph. For your less important and usually smaller size, lengthier text.
&lt;div&gt; - Apparently comes from "Document Divisions." Most commonly used for organization and visual layout purposes
</code></pre>
<p>These preset elements are useful because browsers use this information to understand what your website is about. If you put somet text inside of an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, like <code>&lt;h1&gt;Purple Pandas&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, the browser and other programs are gonna think your whole website is about Purple Pandas! That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>A search on Google for "purple pandas" might turn up your website</li>
<li>A blind person accessing your website will hear "Purple Pandas" as the first thing the browser reads aloud</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the most appropriate, preset tag for a specific part of your website is called using "semantic HTML" - makes sense, because semantics is all about the specifics of using some words over other ones.</p>
<p>Again, this is not necessary to produce valid, functioning HTML. But you'll often see people talking about it as if it is, because the benefits are extremely important.</p>
<p>Here's a list of every single preset element tag in HTML: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element. Warning - there is probably a lot of vocabulary on that site that will look foreign and complicated! Don't worry. Some of those details are very obscure, even to experienced developers. 99% of the time, you'll only be using a handful of the most common ones.</p>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open your HTML file in your text editor again.</li>
<li>Instead of just writing plain text, try using some HTML elements. Play around with a bunch of different tags! Move them around! Nest and un-nest them! Example below.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>   &lt;h1&gt;Funny Cats&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
     This is a website about cats that sit in boxes.
     &lt;strong&gt;Meow&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;button&gt;View The Cats&lt;/button&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;cat 1&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;cat 2&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Save the file and refresh your browser again. You should see your text now in all different styles and sizes, just because you've used some HTML elements!</li>
</ol>

        <h2 id=010>010: Introducing styles</h2>
        <p></p>
        <br />
        <h3 id="whatarestylesandhowdotheywork">What are styles and how do they work?</h3>
<p>Each HTML element is its own building block in a big empty canvas (the web page). And each of blocks can have its own style.</p>
<ul>
<li>Block 1 can be blue, with rounded corners and pink text inside.</li>
<li>Block 2 can be jumping up and down, flashing yellow and purple!</li>
<li>Block 3 can be always stuck at the top of the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these types of traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>color</li>
<li>positioning</li>
<li>animation</li>
<li>shape</li>
<li>size</li>
<li>… and much more</li>
</ul>
<p>…can all be customized through styling. There is a long list of exact, specific characteristics we can change - one common technical term for them is "style properties". Each property has a name, and predefined options it can be set to. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set <code>color</code> to <code>red</code> to make the text color inside an element red.</li>
<li>Set <code>background-color</code> to <code>blue</code> to make the background color of that element blue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="okaysohowdoyouaddastyletoanelement">Okay, so how do you add a style to an element?</h3>
<p>There are two general ways to set these style properties on an HTML element.</p>
<ol>
<li>Directly affect a SINGLE element.</li>
<li>Indirectly affect ANY NUMBER of elements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's start with #1 - we'll come back to #2.</p>
<h3 id="addstyletoonespecificelement">Add style to one specific element.</h3>
<p>Let's look at your HTML file. You should have a couple elements in there, like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;My Title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blah blah blah blah cats are weird.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, you've got two elements. One <code>h1</code>, one <code>p</code> - both with text inside.</p>
<p>The syntax for adding style onto an HTML element looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1 style="color: red; background-color: blue;"&gt;My Title&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Syntax Rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>h1</code> must still be the first thing after the opening bracket <code>&lt;</code></li>
<li>There must be space between <code>h1</code> and <code>style</code></li>
<li><code>style</code> must be lowercase</li>
<li><code>=</code> must come after <code>style</code></li>
<li>Each style property must be exactly written, all lowercase, i.e. <code>color</code> and <code>background-color</code></li>
<li>The value for each property comes directly after the name of the property, following a colon <code>:</code></li>
<li>A semicolon <code>;</code> MUST separate different style properties</li>
<li>All the style properties must be in a single text group surrounded by quotes (either single <code>'</code> or double <code>"</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>Try adding some colors to both elements!</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1 style="color: red; background-color: blue;"&gt;My Title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="color: yellow; background-color: purple;"&gt;Blah blah blah blah cats are weird.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note: other features of this syntax are optional, or purely preferential. Here are some 100% valid ways to write this same code, although some people might say it looks "ugly" or "wrong."</p>
<pre><code>&lt;  h1 style  =  "color:     red;           background-color:blue"&gt;
  My Title
&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>As you'll keep seeing in code, a lot of the guidelines around spacing and formatting are opinions, not requirements.</p>

<li>The value for each property comes directly after the name of the property, following a colon <code>:</code></li>
<li>A semicolon <code>;</code> MUST separate different style properties</li>
<li>All the style properties must be in a single text group surrounded by quotes (either single <code>'</code> or double <code>"</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Try adding some colors to both elements!</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1 style="color: red; background-color: blue;"&gt;My Title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="color: yellow; background-color: purple;"&gt;Blah blah blah blah cats are weird.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note: other features of this syntax are optional, or purely preferential. Here are some 100% valid ways to write this same code, although some people might say it looks "ugly" or "wrong."</p>
<pre><code>&lt;  h1 style  =  "color:     red;           background-color:blue"&gt;
  My Title
&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>As you'll keep seeing in code, a lot of the guidelines around spacing and formatting are opinions, not requirements.</p>
