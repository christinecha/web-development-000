      <h2 id="whatisawebsite">What is a website?</h2>
<p>A website is the stuff that renders in your web browser. When you open up Chrome, or Firefox, or Netscape Navigator, what you see inside the frame is a website.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: point to the inner frame of a web browser</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="howdoesmycomputerknowwhatstufftoshow">How does my computer know what stuff to show?</h2>
<p>When you go to a web address, it's kind of like making a phone call. You direct your request towards a unique web address (ex. www.duckduckgo.com), just like your call requests a specific phone number. The internet companies involved then do a bunch of work to make sure you see the right website, just like the phone companies do to get your call to the right person.</p>
<p>You could go further to say that seeing the website is like hearing a voicemail. Someone somewhere uploaded an audio file, and that same file gets played to you every time you call. Except in the case of a website, instead of just an audio file, it's usually a combination of a whole bunch of different files.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: process of requesting &amp; receiving website? maybe in parallel with the phone call process?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try downloading this file - <a href="./assets/00/cat.txt">cat.txt</a> - and opening in your browser! You can do this by just manually entering the file's address into your browser, i.e. <code>file:///Users/cha/Desktop/cat.txt</code> instead of where you'd normally write <code>http://www.google.com</code>.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/00/local-url.png" alt="Using a local filepath in your browser" /></p>
<p>If you're not sure what this address would be, don't worry! You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>find the file in your computer's file viewer (ex. Windows Explorer or Mac Finder), right click, and "Open With" the browser of your choice.</li>
<li>or open your browser first, and select the file from there. Ex. in Chrome, you'd need to go to File &gt; Open File.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./assets/00/local-url-open.png" alt="Viewing a local file in your browser" /></p>
<p>Oh hey, look at you! In essence, this is all a website is - files opened in a browser. In this case, it's just a plain text file.</p>
<h2 id="whatiscode">What is code?</h2>
<p>Your file right now is just a plaintext* file. You can tell by the <code>.txt</code> extension at the end.</p>
<p>*<em><code>PlainText</code> is actually the technical term here for the file type, not just a descriptive phrase!</em></p>
<p>Other file types (<code>.html</code>, <code>.js</code>, etc.) contain <strong>code</strong>.</p>
<p>Code is just a set of instructions humans can write for machines to read. Code files also just contain text, but each type has different and very particular rules.</p>
<p>Technically, you can write code on any program* on your computer that lets you write text, like TextEdit or Notepad, as long as you can save the file with the correct extension.</p>
<p><em>*Programs like Microsoft Word save a bunch of other data with your text - formatting, preferences, and other data - which is why they use their own specific <code>.doc</code> or <code>.docx</code> extension on these files. If you open one of these in TextEdit, you'll see a bunch of wacky symbols and whatnot; clearly not human-readable text.</em></p>
<h2 id="howcanamachinereadmyhumaninstructions">How can a machine read my human instructions?</h2>
<p>Think of it like a massive chain of translations. A machine on its own has no understanding of your textual instructions. The ony thing that affects a hunk of metal is whether electricity is flowing (often presented by 1) or not (0). That's where all the memes about hackers using binary (01010111010110100010100101) come from; at the end of the day, that sequence is all the machines understand.</p>
<p>At some point, some human was like, what if we group these signals into unique patterns? 01000001 = A, 01000010 = B, so on and so forth. (These are the real patterns, by the way!)</p>
<p>That way, instead of having to write "010000010100001001000011" every time, you could just write "ABC" and automate the translation - way easier. And then we kept repeating this process.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: like the game of telephone, we're passing a message through multiple layers of translators</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a programming language, then, is just one of these "translation layers". In technical terms, the closer you get to the 0's and 1's side, the "lower level" the language is. A higher level language is more layers away, so it usually feels easier for humans to read and write.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: https://mrgcoding.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/language-spectrum.png maybe some robots/machines at one end &amp; people at the other?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when you learn JavaScript, one of the higher level languages, you can write something as simple and human-legible as <code>var x = 9</code> (setting a variable X to the value 9). It feels almost like magic that the computer can "understand" you, but it's just layers and layers of work from engineers past that you can now build on top of.</p>
<h2 id="howdoicreatethesecodefiles">How do I create these code files?</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, you can technically use any program as long as it can output plain text, like TextEdit or Notepad.</p>
<p>However, it might be useful for you to install a text editing application that is meant specifically for programmers, usually called a "text editor" or "I.D.E." ("Integrated Development Environment"). Most of these programs are free so you can always just download one and replace it later to your preferences.</p>
<p>Here are some free options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a></li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Download one of these (or another text editor of your choosing) and you'll be ready to write!</p>
<p>Try opening up your <code>txt</code> file in this text editor. There a lot of different ways to do this (drag the file onto the program icon, use "Open with" again, open it from the text editor via File &gt; Open, etc.) - play around with them and see what's most convenient for you.</p>
<p>Once you have it open, you should be able to edit the text. Write whatever you want in there, hit Save, and refresh your browser - you should see it update to your recent changes.</p>
<p>Congratulations, that's your first website! âœ¨</p>
    
      <h1 id="001">HTML Elements</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Prerequisites:</h4><ul id="prerequisites"><li><a href="./first-website.html">Your First Website</a></li></ul>
      <h2 id="whatishtmlandwhyarewestartingwithit">What is HTML, and why are we starting with it?</h2>
<p>Imagine that your website is a dancer. One day, we want them to perform beautiful choreography! In magnificent costume! Well, HTML is the dancer's bones. It's hard to design a skirt or direct steps if you don't know about legs.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: I mean, I think you get the point here &gt;.&lt;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="creatinganhtmlfile">Creating an HTML file</h2>
<p>So far, we've only used a plain text file (<code>.txt</code>). Now, let's make our first HTML file.</p>
<p>You can either create a new file or just rename the existing file from <code>cat.txt</code> to <code>cat.html</code> to get started. Either way, the important bit is the <code>.html</code> at the end to indicate what programming language it's in. Open it up in your text editor. Let's write some HTML!</p>
<h2 id="howtowritehtml">How to write HTML</h2>
<p>In HTML, things are broken down into elements. (You might also hear them called "blocks" or "tags".) Each HTML element looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>[1]       [2]       [3]
&lt;element&gt; some text &lt;/element&gt;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: Some illustration of the HTML structure as written above? With little arrows pointing to the pieces maybe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each element is indicated by two "tags" (1 &amp; 3), and you can put text between them (2). Eachtag is surrounded by brackets <code>&lt;blerp&gt;</code> but only the second one has the slash <code>&lt;/blerp&gt;</code> so you know where it ends.</p>
<p>The element type is specified inside of the angle brackets.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;blerp&gt;Text&lt;/blerp&gt;&lt;noodle&gt;More Text&lt;/noodle&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, you'd refer to these as "blerp" and "noodle" elements.</p>
<p>Try typing these elements in your <code>.html</code> file. Make your own! Move them around! Type funny quotes inside them! Save your changes, and view the file in your browser again.</p>
<p>Notice that you won't see the element tags, like <code>&lt;blerp&gt;</code>, in your browser - you only see the text you put inside them. This is exactly how all HTML elements work; they simply provide the underlying structure for your content.</p>
<h2 id="nesting">Nesting</h2>
<p>You can also "nest" elements inside one another, with or without text, to produce more complex structures. "Nesting" is a very common concept across programming, not just in HTML. These relationships are often described as "parent" and "child" - in this case, the elements inside are "children", wrapped by their "parent" element.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;grandma&gt;
  Grandma text #1
  &lt;mom&gt;
    &lt;daughter&gt;Shelly&lt;/daughter&gt;
    &lt;daughter&gt;Welly&lt;/daughter&gt;
  &lt;/mom&gt;
  Grandma text #2
  &lt;aunt&gt;
    &lt;cousin&gt;
      &lt;babycousin&gt;Baby text&lt;/babycousin&gt;
    &lt;/cousin&gt;
  &lt;/aunt&gt;
&lt;/grandma&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In our family tree example here, <code>grandma</code> is the "parent" element of <code>mom</code> and <code>aunt</code>, which respectively are "parents" of <code>daughter</code> and <code>cousin</code>. The text inside the elements can also be referred to as their "children". We would even use the term "siblings" to describe the two <code>daughter</code> elements!</p>
<p>(Note: The terms "parent", "child", and "sibling" are actual technical terms that developers use all the time. If you use other, albeit similar, language like "mother" and "daughter" elements, folks might not understand you! ðŸ˜…)</p>
<h2 id="htmlelements">HTML Elements</h2>
<p>Okay, now that we've learned about the general syntax, I'll come clean - <code>blerp</code>, <code>noodle</code>, <code>aunt</code>, and <code>grandma</code> aren't actual HTML elements.</p>
<p><em>(Technically you could call them anything you want and there wouldn't be any visible errors, but then, more technically, that's no longer HTMLâ€¦ more info here if you're curious: https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/#self-closing-tag)</em></p>
<p>There's a huge selection of HTML element types that all browsers have agreed to accept. Here are just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is Heading 1, for important, very large text.</li>
<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is Paragraph, for your less important and usually smaller size but lengthier text.</li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> apparently comes from "Document Divisions." This is commonly used for organization and visual layout purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>These element types are useful because browsers use this information to understand your website's structure and content. For instance, if you put some text inside of an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, like <code>&lt;h1&gt;Purple Pandas&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, the browser will decide this "Purple Pandas" bit must be <em>really</em> important to your website.</p>
<p>Using the most appropriate element for a specific part of your website is commonly called using "semantic HTML".</p>
<p>This is a <em>very important</em> skill to learn if you want your websites to be found by search engines, accessible to non-sighted and/or keyboard users, and more.</p>
<p>That being said, your website could technically be built only using <code>&lt;blerp&gt;</code> elements and still look the same on the outsideâ€¦</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: Some callback to the dancer's bones. Like maybe you have arm bones in your legs but it looks the same on the outside, you know?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a list of every single element tag in HTML: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element. Warning - there is probably a lot of vocabulary on that site that will look foreign and complicated! Don't worry. Some of these are very obscure, even to experienced developers. 99% of the time, you'll only be using a handful of the most common ones.</p>
<h2 id="selfclosingtags">Self-closing tags</h2>
<p>There are some HTML elements that can't contain children (no text, no elements, no nothin' inside!). In these special cases, you use a slightly different format - almost as if you've merged the opening and closing tags into one.</p>
<p>Correct:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;input /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Incorrect:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
&lt;input&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>These elements are called "void elements", and this specific syntax is called a self-closing tag. More info here: https://www.w3.org/Style/customdtd.en.html</p>
<h2 id="yourfirstrealhtmlwebsite">Your first real HTML website</h2>
<p>Try replacing the code in your <code>.html</code> file now with real elements. Here's a quick cheatsheet of some of the most common elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, â€¦ all the way to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> are for heading text (1 is the most important, 6 is the least)</li>
<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is paragraph text</li>
<li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> adds emphasis</li>
<li><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is a line break (must be self-closing)</li>
<li><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> is a horizontal rule (must be self-closing)</li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is usually for nesting other elements inside</li>
<li><code>&lt;button&gt;</code> is, well, a button</li>
<li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code> is for links (stands for "anchor")</li>
<li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> is for an "unordered list", like a bulleted one</li>
<li><code>&lt;li&gt;</code> is a "list item" and should go specifically inside a <code>ul</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Try combining all of the concepts so far into your file. You could write something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;h1&gt;Funny Cats&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Very funny. Ha ha!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This is a &lt;a&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; about cats that sit in boxes.
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Meow&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;button&gt;View The Cats&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;cat 1&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;meow&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cat 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cat 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we're using real HTML elements, you should see something different in your browser now. Your <code>h1</code> text should look very large and your <code>p</code> quite small in comparison. The <code>button</code> should look like, well, a button! And so on.</p>
<p>Look at you go! This is starting to look like the real thing.</p>
<h2 id="nbaboutspacingindentation">NB: About spacing &amp; indentation</h2>
<p>In some cases, specific spacing is required for things to work. But in a lot of cases, it's just personal preference. For example, these three snippets should all work and look the same in your browser:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;
blah blah text content&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;
  blah blah text content

&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>              &lt;h1&gt;
      blah blah text content
          &lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Programmers like to enforce strict indentation rules (always indent when you move into a child element, etc.) so their code is more legible. Your text editor can even automatically do that for you whenever you save your file*.</p>
<p>That being said, remember that this is a stylistic choice, not a requirement! There's nothing about indentation, spacing, or formatting that makes someone fundamentally a <em>better</em> programmer.</p>
<p>*<em>Search "format on save [your-text-editor's-name]" and you'll likely find steps to turn that on.</em></p>
    
      <h1 id="002">HTML Attributes</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Prerequisites:</h4><ul id="prerequisites"><li><a href="./html-elements-intro.html">HTML Elements</a></li></ul>
      <h2 id="whatarehtmlattributes">What are HTML Attributes?</h2>
<p>So now you've learned a couple ways to write HTML elements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Without text inside:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>With text inside:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;Oh fancy meetin' you here&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>With other elements! and text! inside:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Onions&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They have layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So in simple terms, you know how to either make an empty element, or make one with stuff inside.</p>
<p>Using "attributes" is another way to customize how an element shows up on your website. An "attribute", just as its English meaning implies, is a trait that describes your element, just like you might describe yourself!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: On the left, it's me? Maybe curled up in a ball on my couch with a laptop. On the right it's a plain circle. Then caption each like: Me, "shape": "round", "is-moving": "false" (+ maybe one thats differen)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="howtoapplyattributestoanhtmlelement">How to apply attributes to an HTML element</h2>
<p>There are two parts to each element attribute: the name and the value.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div size="large" mood="happy" x="y"&gt;Text&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The attribute name goes after the element name, with some space in between. Then, add an equals sign, followed by the attribute value, which needs to be in quotations. Finally, you have the angle bracket (<code>&gt;</code>) to close your opening tag, and the closing tag stays the same as before.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can omit the equals sign and quote text. (But you must omit BOTH the equals sign &amp; value; including just one will cause an error). This will save your attribute with its custom name but with no defined value.</p>
<p>Here's a <code>div</code> element with the following information attached: it has an attribute called "size" with a value "large", one called "beautiful" with a value "yes", and two called "easy" and "breezy" with both have no value.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div size="large" easy breezy beautiful="yes"&gt;Text&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Just like <code>div</code> and <code>h1</code> came from a long list of all of the existing HTML element types, there's an even longer list of existing attribute types!</p>
<p>All of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes">these attributes</a> are available on every single HTML element type (although they might be useful on some types).</p>
<p>Each element type has its own unique set of existing attributes as well. For instance, if you look up the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attributes">attributes for <code>img</code></a> - the aptly named "image" element - has a whole bunch of attributes: <code>alt</code>, <code>src</code>, <code>width</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Each of these, when added to an HTML element, gives a specific instruction to the browser on how to interpret that element. There might specific rules to what format each value has to be in, too.</p>
<p>For instance, here I'm setting the <code>src</code> attribute to <a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-146582583-min-1.jpg">this image address</a>. This tells the browser: for this <code>img</code> element, display what's at that link.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img
  src="https://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-146582583-min-1.jpg"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>(Did you notice <code>img</code> is one of those self-closing tags? ðŸ˜›)</p>
<p>Here are a few more realistic examples so you can get used to the syntax.</p>
<p>Setting an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> ("anchor" or link) element specific URL using the <code>href</code> attribute.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;a href="https://butt.com"&gt;What smells?&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Maing an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> (yes, "input") element of <code>type</code> "email".</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;input type="email" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Making that image element show up 500 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img
  width="500"
  height="300"
  src="https://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-146582583-min-1.jpg"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Try these out in your <code>.html</code> file! Here are some practice ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add two different images but make them show up as same exact size. (Tip: To get the web address of an image, try ctrl+clicking an image on a website and hiting "Copy Image Address")</li>
<li>Set up a classic prank by creating an innocent-looking link that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">goes here</a></li>

<p>Oh hey, look at you! In essence, this is all a website is - files opened in a browser. In this case, it's just a plain text file.</p>
<h2 id="whatiscode">What is code?</h2>
<p>Your file right now is just a plaintext* file. You can tell by the <code>.txt</code> extension at the end.</p>
<p>*<em><code>PlainText</code> is actually the technical term here for the file type, not just a descriptive phrase!</em></p>
<p>Other file types (<code>.html</code>, <code>.js</code>, etc.) contain <strong>code</strong>.</p>
<p>Code is just a set of instructions humans can write for machines to read. Code files also just contain text, but each type has different and very particular rules.</p>
<p>Technically, you can write code on any program* on your computer that lets you write text, like TextEdit or Notepad, as long as you can save the file with the correct extension.</p>
<p><em>*Programs like Microsoft Word save a bunch of other data with your text - formatting, preferences, and other data - which is why they use their own specific <code>.doc</code> or <code>.docx</code> extension on these files. If you open one of these in TextEdit, you'll see a bunch of wacky symbols and whatnot; clearly not human-readable text.</em></p>
<h2 id="howcanamachinereadmyhumaninstructions">How can a machine read my human instructions?</h2>
<p>Think of it like a massive chain of translations. A machine on its own has no understanding of your textual instructions. The ony thing that affects a hunk of metal is whether electricity is flowing (often presented by 1) or not (0). That's where all the memes about hackers using binary (01010111010110100010100101) come from; at the end of the day, that sequence is all the machines understand.</p>
<p>At some point, some human was like, what if we group these signals into unique patterns? 01000001 = A, 01000010 = B, so on and so forth. (These are the real patterns, by the way!)</p>
<p>That way, instead of having to write "010000010100001001000011" every time, you could just write "ABC" and automate the translation - way easier. And then we kept repeating this process.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: like the game of telephone, we're passing a message through multiple layers of translators</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a programming language, then, is just one of these "translation layers". In technical terms, the closer you get to the 0's and 1's side, the "lower level" the language is. A higher level language is more layers away, so it usually feels easier for humans to read and write.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: https://mrgcoding.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/language-spectrum.png maybe some robots/machines at one end &amp; people at the other?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when you learn JavaScript, one of the higher level languages, you can write something as simple and human-legible as <code>var x = 9</code> (setting a variable X to the value 9). It feels almost like magic that the computer can "understand" you, but it's just layers and layers of work from engineers past that you can now build on top of.</p>
<h2 id="howdoicreatethesecodefiles">How do I create these code files?</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, you can technically use any program as long as it can output plain text, like TextEdit or Notepad.</p>
<p>However, it might be useful for you to install a text editing application that is meant specifically for programmers, usually called a "text editor" or "I.D.E." ("Integrated Development Environment"). Most of these programs are free so you can always just download one and replace it later to your preferences.</p>
<p>Here are some free options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a></li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Download one of these (or another text editor of your choosing) and you'll be ready to write!</p>
<p>Try opening up your <code>txt</code> file in this text editor. There a lot of different ways to do this (drag the file onto the program icon, use "Open with" again, open it from the text editor via File &gt; Open, etc.) - play around with them and see what's most convenient for you.</p>
<p>Once you have it open, you should be able to edit the text. Write whatever you want in there, hit Save, and refresh your browser - you should see it update to your recent changes.</p>
<p>Congratulations, that's your first website! âœ¨</p>
    
      <h1 id="001">HTML Elements</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Prerequisites:</h4><ul id="prerequisites"><li><a href="./first-website.html">Your First Website</a></li></ul>
      <h2 id="whatishtmlandwhyarewestartingwithit">What is HTML, and why are we starting with it?</h2>
<p>Imagine that your website is a dancer. One day, we want them to perform beautiful choreography! In magnificent costume! Well, HTML is the dancer's bones. It's hard to design a skirt or direct steps if you don't know about legs.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: I mean, I think you get the point here &gt;.&lt;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="creatinganhtmlfile">Creating an HTML file</h2>
<p>So far, we've only used a plain text file (<code>.txt</code>). Now, let's make our first HTML file.</p>
<p>You can either create a new file or just rename the existing file from <code>cat.txt</code> to <code>cat.html</code> to get started. Either way, the important bit is the <code>.html</code> at the end to indicate what programming language it's in. Open it up in your text editor. Let's write some HTML!</p>
<h2 id="howtowritehtml">How to write HTML</h2>
<p>In HTML, things are broken down into elements. (You might also hear them called "blocks" or "tags".) Each HTML element looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>[1]       [2]       [3]
&lt;element&gt; some text &lt;/element&gt;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: Some illustration of the HTML structure as written above? With little arrows pointing to the pieces maybe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each element is indicated by two "tags" (1 &amp; 3), and you can put text between them (2). Eachtag is surrounded by brackets <code>&lt;blerp&gt;</code> but only the second one has the slash <code>&lt;/blerp&gt;</code> so you know where it ends.</p>
<p>The element type is specified inside of the angle brackets.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;blerp&gt;Text&lt;/blerp&gt;&lt;noodle&gt;More Text&lt;/noodle&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, you'd refer to these as "blerp" and "noodle" elements.</p>
<p>Try typing these elements in your <code>.html</code> file. Make your own! Move them around! Type funny quotes inside them! Save your changes, and view the file in your browser again.</p>
<p>Notice that you won't see the element tags, like <code>&lt;blerp&gt;</code>, in your browser - you only see the text you put inside them. This is exactly how all HTML elements work; they simply provide the underlying structure for your content.</p>
<h2 id="nesting">Nesting</h2>
<p>You can also "nest" elements inside one another, with or without text, to produce more complex structures. "Nesting" is a very common concept across programming, not just in HTML. These relationships are often described as "parent" and "child" - in this case, the elements inside are "children", wrapped by their "parent" element.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;grandma&gt;
  Grandma text #1
  &lt;mom&gt;
    &lt;daughter&gt;Shelly&lt;/daughter&gt;
    &lt;daughter&gt;Welly&lt;/daughter&gt;
  &lt;/mom&gt;
  Grandma text #2
  &lt;aunt&gt;
    &lt;cousin&gt;
      &lt;babycousin&gt;Baby text&lt;/babycousin&gt;
    &lt;/cousin&gt;
  &lt;/aunt&gt;
&lt;/grandma&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In our family tree example here, <code>grandma</code> is the "parent" element of <code>mom</code> and <code>aunt</code>, which respectively are "parents" of <code>daughter</code> and <code>cousin</code>. The text inside the elements can also be referred to as their "children". We would even use the term "siblings" to describe the two <code>daughter</code> elements!</p>
<p>(Note: The terms "parent", "child", and "sibling" are actual technical terms that developers use all the time. If you use other, albeit similar, language like "mother" and "daughter" elements, folks might not understand you! ðŸ˜…)</p>
<h2 id="htmlelements">HTML Elements</h2>
<p>Okay, now that we've learned about the general syntax, I'll come clean - <code>blerp</code>, <code>noodle</code>, <code>aunt</code>, and <code>grandma</code> aren't actual HTML elements.</p>
<p><em>(Technically you could call them anything you want and there wouldn't be any visible errors, but then, more technically, that's no longer HTMLâ€¦ more info here if you're curious: https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/#self-closing-tag)</em></p>
<p>There's a huge selection of HTML element types that all browsers have agreed to accept. Here are just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is Heading 1, for important, very large text.</li>
<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is Paragraph, for your less important and usually smaller size but lengthier text.</li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> apparently comes from "Document Divisions." This is commonly used for organization and visual layout purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>These element types are useful because browsers use this information to understand your website's structure and content. For instance, if you put some text inside of an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, like <code>&lt;h1&gt;Purple Pandas&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, the browser will decide this "Purple Pandas" bit must be <em>really</em> important to your website.</p>
<p>Using the most appropriate element for a specific part of your website is commonly called using "semantic HTML".</p>
<p>This is a <em>very important</em> skill to learn if you want your websites to be found by search engines, accessible to non-sighted and/or keyboard users, and more.</p>
<p>That being said, your website could technically be built only using <code>&lt;blerp&gt;</code> elements and still look the same on the outsideâ€¦</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: Some callback to the dancer's bones. Like maybe you have arm bones in your legs but it looks the same on the outside, you know?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a list of every single element tag in HTML: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element. Warning - there is probably a lot of vocabulary on that site that will look foreign and complicated! Don't worry. Some of these are very obscure, even to experienced developers. 99% of the time, you'll only be using a handful of the most common ones.</p>
<h2 id="selfclosingtags">Self-closing tags</h2>
<p>There are some HTML elements that can't contain children (no text, no elements, no nothin' inside!). In these special cases, you use a slightly different format - almost as if you've merged the opening and closing tags into one.</p>
<p>Correct:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;input /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Incorrect:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
&lt;input&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>These elements are called "void elements", and this specific syntax is called a self-closing tag. More info here: https://www.w3.org/Style/customdtd.en.html</p>
<h2 id="yourfirstrealhtmlwebsite">Your first real HTML website</h2>
<p>Try replacing the code in your <code>.html</code> file now with real elements. Here's a quick cheatsheet of some of the most common elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, â€¦ all the way to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> are for heading text (1 is the most important, 6 is the least)</li>
<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is paragraph text</li>
<li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> adds emphasis</li>
<li><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is a line break (must be self-closing)</li>
<li><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> is a horizontal rule (must be self-closing)</li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is usually for nesting other elements inside</li>
<li><code>&lt;button&gt;</code> is, well, a button</li>
<li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code> is for links (stands for "anchor")</li>
<li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> is for an "unordered list", like a bulleted one</li>
<li><code>&lt;li&gt;</code> is a "list item" and should go specifically inside a <code>ul</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Try combining all of the concepts so far into your file. You could write something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;h1&gt;Funny Cats&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Very funny. Ha ha!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This is a &lt;a&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; about cats that sit in boxes.
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Meow&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;button&gt;View The Cats&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;cat 1&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;meow&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cat 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cat 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we're using real HTML elements, you should see something different in your browser now. Your <code>h1</code> text should look very large and your <code>p</code> quite small in comparison. The <code>button</code> should look like, well, a button! And so on.</p>
<p>Look at you go! This is starting to look like the real thing.</p>
<h2 id="nbaboutspacingindentation">NB: About spacing &amp; indentation</h2>
<p>In some cases, specific spacing is required for things to work. But in a lot of cases, it's just personal preference. For example, these three snippets should all work and look the same in your browser:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;
blah blah text content&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;
  blah blah text content

&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>              &lt;h1&gt;
      blah blah text content
          &lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Programmers like to enforce strict indentation rules (always indent when you move into a child element, etc.) so their code is more legible. Your text editor can even automatically do that for you whenever you save your file*.</p>
<p>That being said, remember that this is a stylistic choice, not a requirement! There's nothing about indentation, spacing, or formatting that makes someone fundamentally a <em>better</em> programmer.</p>
<p>*<em>Search "format on save [your-text-editor's-name]" and you'll likely find steps to turn that on.</em></p>
    
      <h1 id="002">HTML Attributes</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Prerequisites:</h4><ul id="prerequisites"><li><a href="./html-elements-intro.html">HTML Elements</a></li></ul>
      <h2 id="whatarehtmlattributes">What are HTML Attributes?</h2>
<p>So now you've learned a couple ways to write HTML elements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Without text inside:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>With text inside:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;Oh fancy meetin' you here&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>With other elements! and text! inside:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Onions&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They have layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So in simple terms, you know how to either make an empty element, or make one with stuff inside.</p>
<p>Using "attributes" is another way to customize how an element shows up on your website. An "attribute", just as its English meaning implies, is a trait that describes your element, just like you might describe yourself!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: On the left, it's me? Maybe curled up in a ball on my couch with a laptop. On the right it's a plain circle. Then caption each like: Me, "shape": "round", "is-moving": "false" (+ maybe one thats differen)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="howtoapplyattributestoanhtmlelement">How to apply attributes to an HTML element</h2>
<p>There are two parts to each element attribute: the name and the value.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div size="large" mood="happy" x="y"&gt;Text&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The attribute name goes after the element name, with some space in between. Then, add an equals sign, followed by the attribute value, which needs to be in quotations. Finally, you have the angle bracket (<code>&gt;</code>) to close your opening tag, and the closing tag stays the same as before.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can omit the equals sign and quote text. (But you must omit BOTH the equals sign &amp; value; including just one will cause an error). This will save your attribute with its custom name but with no defined value.</p>
<p>Here's a <code>div</code> element with the following information attached: it has an attribute called "size" with a value "large", one called "beautiful" with a value "yes", and two called "easy" and "breezy" with both have no value.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div size="large" easy breezy beautiful="yes"&gt;Text&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Just like <code>div</code> and <code>h1</code> came from a long list of all of the existing HTML element types, there's an even longer list of existing attribute types!</p>
<p>All of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes">these attributes</a> are available on every single HTML element type (although they might be useful on some types).</p>
<p>Each element type has its own unique set of existing attributes as well. For instance, if you look up the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attributes">attributes for <code>img</code></a> - the aptly named "image" element - has a whole bunch of attributes: <code>alt</code>, <code>src</code>, <code>width</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Each of these, when added to an HTML element, gives a specific instruction to the browser on how to interpret that element. There might specific rules to what format each value has to be in, too.</p>
<p>For instance, here I'm setting the <code>src</code> attribute to <a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-146582583-min-1.jpg">this image address</a>. This tells the browser: for this <code>img</code> element, display what's at that link.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img
  src="https://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-146582583-min-1.jpg"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>(Did you notice <code>img</code> is one of those self-closing tags? ðŸ˜›)</p>
<p>Here are a few more realistic examples so you can get used to the syntax.</p>
<p>Setting an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> ("anchor" or link) element specific URL using the <code>href</code> attribute.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;a href="https://butt.com"&gt;What smells?&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Maing an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> (yes, "input") element of <code>type</code> "email".</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;input type="email" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Making that image element show up 500 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img
  width="500"
  height="300"
  src="https://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-146582583-min-1.jpg"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Try these out in your <code>.html</code> file! Here are some practice ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add two different images but make them show up as same exact size. (Tip: To get the web address of an image, try ctrl+clicking an image on a website and hiting "Copy Image Address")</li>
<li>Set up a classic prank by creating an innocent-looking link that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">goes here</a></li>
</ul>
    
      <h1 id="010">Introducing styles</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Prerequisites:</h4><ul id="prerequisites"><li><a href="./html-attributes-intro.html">HTML Attributes</a></li></ul>
      <h2 id="whatisstyling">What is styling?</h2>
<p>You could certainly build a perfectly functional and useful website just using plain HTML. But if you want to customize the look of it, you'll need to learn about styling.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: functional but drab/default vs functional &amp; looks good? doesn't have to be literal, something fun?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each HTML element in your <code>.html</code> file can have its own unique style.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;Block 1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Block 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Block 3&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If that's all you write in your <code>.html</code> file, your browser will just show three plain lines of text.</p>
<p>But with custom styling, you could put "Block 1" into a blue rectangle with rounded corners and pink text inside. "Block 2" could be jumping up and down, flashing yellow and purple! "Block 3" could always be stuck at the top of the page no matter how much you scroll.</p>
<p>You can style an element's color, positioning, animation, shape, size, and so much more. There are <em>hundreds</em> of traits, called "properties", that you can customize! Just like how <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a specific element name in HTML, these properties belong to another language, called <code>CSS</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some very commonly used CSS properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>color</code> - the color of the text inside the element</li>
<li><code>background-color</code> - the background color of the element</li>
<li><code>font-size</code> - the size of the text inside the element</li>
<li><code>width</code> &amp; <code>height</code> - the width &amp; height of the element</li>
<li>â€¦ and so on!</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these CSS properties has particular rules on what you can set them to. For instance, <code>font-size</code> can take a value like <code>10px</code>, which would make your text 10 pixels tall. You'll encounter an error if you just set it to <code>10</code> though, because as a rule, <code>font-size</code> requires units.</p>
<p>Hundreds of properties - each with their own particular set of rules. Yeah, this is often the most intimidating part of styling.</p>
<p>But don't worry! Learning to code isn't about memorizing everything. In fact, one of the most important skills a programmer can have is being able to search for answers online effectively.</p>
<p>If you forgot how <code>font-size</code> works, for instance, you could search "font-size CSS" and get endless explanations. With common issues, you can likely even search your specific problem, ex. "font-size 10 not working css" and someone on the other side of the globe will have a blog post about it. The beauty of the web!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: Some ridiculously specific question (not web related even) and someone on the other side of the world answering it?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="okaybuthowdoyouaddthesepropertiestoanhtmlelement">Okay, but how do you add these properties to an HTML element?</h2>
<p>We previously learned about HTML attributes and how to use them to save information about a specific element. Like setting an image element's source:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img
  src="https://funnyfoto.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cat-saturday-30-photos-91_07_02_2018.jpg"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>One of most useful attributes is called <code>style</code>. This is one of those "global" attributes - one that is available on every type of HTML element from.</p>
<p>Just like CSS properties, each HTML attribute has specific rules about what kind of values it will accept. The rule with the <code>style</code> attribute is that its value always has to be formatted as CSS code.</p>
<h2 id="letswritesomecss">Let's write some CSS!</h2>
<p>Now that we've gotten comfortable with how to write in the HTML language, it's time to learn another. In CSS, correct syntax looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">color: red;
background-color: blue;
</code></pre>
<p>For each property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property name comes first (always lowercase, never with spaces, dashed between words)</li>
<li>Then a colon (<code>:</code>)</li>
<li>Then the property value</li>
<li>Finally, a semicolon (<code>;</code>) to mark the end of the value</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nbsmallspacingformattingnotes">NB: Small spacing &amp; formatting notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The spaces are not required. Writing the same CSS as <code>color:red;background-color:blue;</code> is completely valid.</li>
<li>Semicolons are required between different properties. Since there's no property following <code>background-color</code>, you technically don't need one there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we just need to take that little chunk of CSS code and set that as the value to a <code>style</code> attribute on one of our HTML elements:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="color: red; background-color: pink;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: yellow;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font-size: 30px;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Try writing similarly styled HTML elements in your <code>.html</code> file. When you view your website (remember, save the file and then refresh your browser!), you should see different colors and font sizes! Hooray!</p>
<h2 id="nbdefaultstyles">NB: Default styles</h2>
<p>HTML elements come with some default styles. Remember how big the <code>h1</code> was in comparison to the <code>p</code> text, even before you added any <code>style</code> attributes? That's because your browser gives <code>h1</code> a default <code>font-size</code> style that is larger than the default of <code>p</code>. And <code>button</code> has a border by default. And so on.</p>
<p>You'll notice that depending on which browser you open up your .<code>html</code> file in, the default styling might also look slightly different. This is because, although the leading browsers have agreed on a lot of things, there are still areas where they diverge.</p>
<p>This is important to know for when your cousin, who still uses Internet Explorer, asks you why your website looks so different on their screen!</p>

<p>This is not a joke. Try these colors out and see for yourself!</p>
<p>(Some developers at some point in time were given the power to make up color names, and that's what they came up with.)</p>
<p>Here you can find all 147 predefined color names, or "color keywords", available in CSS: https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords</p>
<p>But wait! Haven't I seen more than 147 colors on the internet? (Also, isn't it ridiculous to type "papayawhip" every time?)</p>
<h2 id="rgbredgreenbluecolor">RGB (Red, Green, Blue) Color</h2>
<p>Any color you see on your computer screen is produced by red, green, and blue lights shining out from it. This mix of color lights then blend together to make your brain think it's actually a single color!</p>
<p>Here's the Wikipedia page how RGB works and where it came from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB<em>color</em>model.</p>
<p>In CSS, the amount of each color light you want is measured from 0 to 255, 0 being none of that light and 255 being the most possible amount. So to specify the specific color you want to make, you have to define these amounts.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> red, <code>0</code> green, and <code>0</code> blue = <strong>black</strong> (no light at all)</li>
<li><code>255</code> red, <code>0</code> green, and <code>0</code> blue = <strong>bright red</strong> (only red light - and the max amount of it)</li>
<li><code>255</code> red, <code>255</code> green, and <code>0</code> blue = <strong>bright yellow</strong> (red + green light)</li>
<li><code>255</code> red, <code>255</code> green, and <code>255</code> blue = <strong>white</strong> (all colors at full blast)</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, to actually use these mini recipes in your code, you'll need the proper syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black: <code>rgb(0,0,0)</code></li>
<li>Bright Red: <code>rgb(255,0,0)</code></li>
<li>Bright Yellow: <code>rgb(255,255,0)</code></li>
<li>White: <code>rgb(255,255,255)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The format you need is <code>rgb</code>, then the color values in order (red, then green, then blue) in parentheses. The numbers must be separated by commas. As seen in some previous CSS, everything must be lowercase.</p>
<h2 id="applyingcolorvaluestostyles">Applying color values to styles</h2>
<p>Now that you know how to code a specific color value, you can use it in your CSS styles!</p>
<p>Previously we were using color shortcuts "red" and "pink":</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="color: red; background-color: pink;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now try putting in your own custom RGB colors!</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="color: rgb(200,120,0); background-color: rgb(90,20,30);"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Do you know what colors these combinations will make? Well, neither can I (besides some educated guesses). Don't worry about having to memorize these numbers or even being able to know what color they are at a glance. There are so many tools that will do this for you!</p>
<h2 id="hexcolors">Hex Colors</h2>
<p>You can also format RGB colors as "hexadecimal" numbers, often called "hex codes" or "hex colors". It's the same concept - three numbers for red, green, and blue amounts - just formatted differently:</p>
<pre><code>#ae13f4
</code></pre>
<p>That probably looks confusing. Let's break it down. The <code>#</code> at the beginning is a required prefix to indicate you're using a hex code. This will be the same for every color. Then a code of exactly 6 characters.[^1]</p>
<p>These 6 characters are actually 3 pairs; the first two represent the R (red) amount, the next two are for G (green), and finally the last two are for B (blue). Believe it or not, each of these pairs still just translates to a number from 0 to 25!</p>
<pre><code>Red amount:   ae = 174
Green amount: 13 = 19
Blue amount:  f4 = 244
</code></pre>
<p>So that means these should look exactly the same:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: rgb(174,19,244);"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: #ae13f4;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Confused? The reason you see letters and numbers is because we're counting in base 16.</p>
<p>Usually we count in base 10 using the numbers 0 - 9. In base 16, you need 16 digits instead of 10. Since those numbers don't exist in our day-to-day usage, we pull in letters: 0 - 9, then a - f. (More info: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)</p>
<pre><code>Hexadecimal (Base 16): 0 1 2 ... 8 9 a  b  c  d  e  f
"Normal" (Base 10):    0 1 2 ... 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
</code></pre>
<p>The highest possible number using only two digits is <code>ff</code>, which, not coincidentally, is the equivalent of <code>255</code> - sound familiar?</p>
<h2 id="alltogethernow">All together now!</h2>
<p>Now you've learned three different ways to format a color value in CSS. These three blocks should all look identical:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: black;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: rgb(0,0,0);"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And so should these:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: red;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0);"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: #ff0000;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You'll see all three types used very commonly, so it's important to be able to recognize and understand them all. In your own use, choose whatever feels more comfortable for each case.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
<p>[^1]: You might discover, by accident or otherwise, that a 3-character hex code (ex. <code>#fff</code>) also works. This format is sometimes used as a shorthand when all three (R, G, and B) hexadecimal numbers are doubles of the same character. Ex. <code>#f0a</code> actually denotes <code>#ff00aa</code>, <code>#b9c</code> is <code>#bb99cc</code>, etc.</p>

      <h2 id="whatisstyling">What is styling?</h2>
<p>You could certainly build a perfectly functional and useful website just using plain HTML. But if you want to customize the look of it, you'll need to learn about styling.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: functional but drab/default vs functional &amp; looks good? doesn't have to be literal, something fun?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each HTML element in your <code>.html</code> file can have its own unique style.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;Block 1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Block 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Block 3&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If that's all you write in your <code>.html</code> file, your browser will just show three plain lines of text.</p>
<p>But with custom styling, you could put "Block 1" into a blue rectangle with rounded corners and pink text inside. "Block 2" could be jumping up and down, flashing yellow and purple! "Block 3" could always be stuck at the top of the page no matter how much you scroll.</p>
<p>You can style an element's color, positioning, animation, shape, size, and so much more. There are <em>hundreds</em> of traits, called "properties", that you can customize! Just like how <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a specific element name in HTML, these properties belong to another language, called <code>CSS</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some very commonly used CSS properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>color</code> - the color of the text inside the element</li>
<li><code>background-color</code> - the background color of the element</li>
<li><code>font-size</code> - the size of the text inside the element</li>
<li><code>width</code> &amp; <code>height</code> - the width &amp; height of the element</li>
<li>â€¦ and so on!</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these CSS properties has particular rules on what you can set them to. For instance, <code>font-size</code> can take a value like <code>10px</code>, which would make your text 10 pixels tall. You'll encounter an error if you just set it to <code>10</code> though, because as a rule, <code>font-size</code> requires units.</p>
<p>Hundreds of properties - each with their own particular set of rules. Yeah, this is often the most intimidating part of styling.</p>
<p>But don't worry! Learning to code isn't about memorizing everything. In fact, one of the most important skills a programmer can have is being able to search for answers online effectively.</p>
<p>If you forgot how <code>font-size</code> works, for instance, you could search "font-size CSS" and get endless explanations. With common issues, you can likely even search your specific problem, ex. "font-size 10 not working css" and someone on the other side of the globe will have a blog post about it. The beauty of the web!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: Some ridiculously specific question (not web related even) and someone on the other side of the world answering it?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="okaybuthowdoyouaddthesepropertiestoanhtmlelement">Okay, but how do you add these properties to an HTML element?</h2>
<p>We previously learned about HTML attributes and how to use them to save information about a specific element. Like setting an image element's source:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img
  src="https://funnyfoto.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cat-saturday-30-photos-91_07_02_2018.jpg"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>One of most useful attributes is called <code>style</code>. This is one of those "global" attributes - one that is available on every type of HTML element from.</p>
<p>Just like CSS properties, each HTML attribute has specific rules about what kind of values it will accept. The rule with the <code>style</code> attribute is that its value always has to be formatted as CSS code.</p>
<h2 id="letswritesomecss">Let's write some CSS!</h2>
<p>Now that we've gotten comfortable with how to write in the HTML language, it's time to learn another. In CSS, correct syntax looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">color: red;
background-color: blue;
</code></pre>
<p>For each property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property name comes first (always lowercase, never with spaces, dashed between words)</li>
<li>Then a colon (<code>:</code>)</li>
<li>Then the property value</li>
<li>Finally, a semicolon (<code>;</code>) to mark the end of the value</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nbsmallspacingformattingnotes">NB: Small spacing &amp; formatting notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The spaces are not required. Writing the same CSS as <code>color:red;background-color:blue;</code> is completely valid.</li>
<li>Semicolons are required between different properties. Since there's no property following <code>background-color</code>, you technically don't need one there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we just need to take that little chunk of CSS code and set that as the value to a <code>style</code> attribute on one of our HTML elements:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="color: red; background-color: pink;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: yellow;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font-size: 30px;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Try writing similarly styled HTML elements in your <code>.html</code> file. When you view your website (remember, save the file and then refresh your browser!), you should see different colors and font sizes! Hooray!</p>
<h2 id="nbdefaultstyles">NB: Default styles</h2>
<p>HTML elements come with some default styles. Remember how big the <code>h1</code> was in comparison to the <code>p</code> text, even before you added any <code>style</code> attributes? That's because your browser gives <code>h1</code> a default <code>font-size</code> style that is larger than the default of <code>p</code>. And <code>button</code> has a border by default. And so on.</p>
<p>You'll notice that depending on which browser you open up your .<code>html</code> file in, the default styling might also look slightly different. This is because, although the leading browsers have agreed on a lot of things, there are still areas where they diverge.</p>
<p>This is important to know for when your cousin, who still uses Internet Explorer, asks you why your website looks so different on their screen!</p>

      <p></p>
      
      <h2 id="whatisawebsite">What is a website?</h2>
<p>A website is the stuff that renders in your web browser. When you open up Chrome, or Firefox, or Netscape Navigator, what you see inside the frame is a website.</p>
<blockquote>

<h2 id="howdoesmycomputerknowwhatstufftoshow">How does my computer know what stuff to show?</h2>
<p>When you go to a web address, it's kind of like making a phone call. You direct your request towards a unique web address (ex. www.duckduckgo.com), just like your call requests a specific phone number. The internet companies involved then do a bunch of work to make sure you see the right website, just like the phone companies do to get your call to the right person.</p>
<p>You could go further to say that seeing the website is like hearing a voicemail. Someone somewhere uploaded an audio file, and that same file gets played to you every time you call. Except in the case of a website, instead of just an audio file, it's usually a combination of a whole bunch of different files.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: process of requesting &amp; receiving website? maybe in parallel with the phone call process?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try downloading this file - <a href="./assets/00/cat.txt">cat.txt</a> - and opening in your browser! You can do this by just manually entering the file's address into your browser, i.e. <code>file:///Users/cha/Desktop/cat.txt</code> instead of where you'd normally write <code>http://www.google.com</code>.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/00/local-url.png" alt="Using a local filepath in your browser" /></p>
<p>If you're not sure what this address would be, don't worry! You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>find the file in your computer's file viewer (ex. Windows Explorer or Mac Finder), right click, and "Open With" the browser of your choice.</li>
<li>or open your browser first, and select the file from there. Ex. in Chrome, you'd need to go to File &gt; Open File.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./assets/00/local-url-open.png" alt="Viewing a local file in your browser" /></p>
<p>Oh hey, look at you! In essence, this is all a website is - files opened in a browser. In this case, it's just a plain text file.</p>
<h2 id="whatiscode">What is code?</h2>
<p>Your file right now is just a plaintext* file. You can tell by the <code>.txt</code> extension at the end.</p>
<p>*<em><code>PlainText</code> is actually the technical term here for the file type, not just a descriptive phrase!</em></p>
<p>Other file types (<code>.html</code>, <code>.js</code>, etc.) contain <strong>code</strong>.</p>
<p>Code is just a set of instructions humans can write for machines to read. Code files also just contain text, but each type has different and very particular rules.</p>
<p>Technically, you can write code on any program* on your computer that lets you write text, like TextEdit or Notepad, as long as you can save the file with the correct extension.</p>
<p><em>*Programs like Microsoft Word save a bunch of other data with your text - formatting, preferences, and other data - which is why they use their own specific <code>.doc</code> or <code>.docx</code> extension on these files. If you open one of these in TextEdit, you'll see a bunch of wacky symbols and whatnot; clearly not human-readable text.</em></p>
<h2 id="howcanamachinereadmyhumaninstructions">How can a machine read my human instructions?</h2>
<p>Think of it like a massive chain of translations. A machine on its own has no understanding of your textual instructions. The ony thing that affects a hunk of metal is whether electricity is flowing (often presented by 1) or not (0). That's where all the memes about hackers using binary (01010111010110100010100101) come from; at the end of the day, that sequence is all the machines understand.</p>
<p>At some point, some human was like, what if we group these signals into unique patterns? 01000001 = A, 01000010 = B, so on and so forth. (These are the real patterns, by the way!)</p>
<p>That way, instead of having to write "010000010100001001000011" every time, you could just write "ABC" and automate the translation - way easier. And then we kept repeating this process.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: like the game of telephone, we're passing a message through multiple layers of translators</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a programming language, then, is just one of these "translation layers". In technical terms, the closer you get to the 0's and 1's side, the "lower level" the language is. A higher level language is more layers away, so it usually feels easier for humans to read and write.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: https://mrgcoding.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/language-spectrum.png maybe some robots/machines at one end &amp; people at the other?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when you learn JavaScript, one of the higher level languages, you can write something as simple and human-legible as <code>var x = 9</code> (setting a variable X to the value 9). It feels almost like magic that the computer can "understand" you, but it's just layers and layers of work from engineers past that you can now build on top of.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, you can technically use any program as long as it can output plain text, like TextEdit or Notepad.</p>
<p>However, it might be useful for you to install a text editing application that is meant specifically for programmers, usually called a "text editor" or "I.D.E." ("Integrated Development Environment"). Most of these programs are free so you can always just download one and replace it later to your preferences.</p>
<p>Here are some free options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a></li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Download one of these (or another text editor of your choosing) and you'll be ready to write!</p>
<p>Try opening up your <code>txt</code> file in this text editor. There a lot of different ways to do this (drag the file onto the program icon, use "Open with" again, open it from the text editor via File &gt; Open, etc.) - play around with them and see what's most convenient for you.</p>
<p>Once you have it open, you should be able to edit the text. Write whatever you want in there, hit Save, and refresh your browser - you should see it update to your recent changes.</p>
<p>Congratulations, that's your first website! âœ¨</p>
    
      <h1 id="001">HTML Elements</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Prerequisites:</h4><ul id="prerequisites"><li><a href="./first-website.html">Your First Website</a></li></ul>
      <h2 id="whatishtmlandwhyarewestartingwithit">What is HTML, and why are we starting with it?</h2>
<p>Imagine that your website is a dancer. One day, we want them to perform beautiful choreography! In magnificent costume! Well, HTML is the dancer's bones. It's hard to design a skirt or direct steps if you don't know about legs.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: I mean, I think you get the point here &gt;.&lt;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="creatinganhtmlfile">Creating an HTML file</h2>
<p>So far, we've only used a plain text file (<code>.txt</code>). Now, let's make our first HTML file.</p>
<p>You can either create a new file or just rename the existing file from <code>cat.txt</code> to <code>cat.html</code> to get started. Either way, the important bit is the <code>.html</code> at the end to indicate what programming language it's in. Open it up in your text editor. Let's write some HTML!</p>
<h2 id="howtowritehtml">How to write HTML</h2>
<p>In HTML, things are broken down into elements. (You might also hear them called "blocks" or "tags".) Each HTML element looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>[1]       [2]       [3]
&lt;element&gt; some text &lt;/element&gt;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: Some illustration of the HTML structure as written above? With little arrows pointing to the pieces maybe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each element is indicated by two "tags" (1 &amp; 3), and you can put text between them (2). Eachtag is surrounded by brackets <code>&lt;blerp&gt;</code> but only the second one has the slash <code>&lt;/blerp&gt;</code> so you know where it ends.</p>
<p>The element type is specified inside of the angle brackets.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;blerp&gt;Text&lt;/blerp&gt;&lt;noodle&gt;More Text&lt;/noodle&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, you'd refer to these as "blerp" and "noodle" elements.</p>
<p>Try typing these elements in your <code>.html</code> file. Make your own! Move them around! Type funny quotes inside them! Save your changes, and view the file in your browser again.</p>
<p>Notice that you won't see the element tags, like <code>&lt;blerp&gt;</code>, in your browser - you only see the text you put inside them. This is exactly how all HTML elements work; they simply provide the underlying structure for your content.</p>
<h2 id="nesting">Nesting</h2>
<p>You can also "nest" elements inside one another, with or without text, to produce more complex structures. "Nesting" is a very common concept across programming, not just in HTML. These relationships are often described as "parent" and "child" - in this case, the elements inside are "children", wrapped by their "parent" element.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;grandma&gt;
  Grandma text #1
  &lt;mom&gt;
    &lt;daughter&gt;Shelly&lt;/daughter&gt;
    &lt;daughter&gt;Welly&lt;/daughter&gt;
  &lt;/mom&gt;
  Grandma text #2
  &lt;aunt&gt;
    &lt;cousin&gt;
      &lt;babycousin&gt;Baby text&lt;/babycousin&gt;
    &lt;/cousin&gt;
  &lt;/aunt&gt;
&lt;/grandma&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In our family tree example here, <code>grandma</code> is the "parent" element of <code>mom</code> and <code>aunt</code>, which respectively are "parents" of <code>daughter</code> and <code>cousin</code>. The text inside the elements can also be referred to as their "children". We would even use the term "siblings" to describe the two <code>daughter</code> elements!</p>
<p>(Note: The terms "parent", "child", and "sibling" are actual technical terms that developers use all the time. If you use other, albeit similar, language like "mother" and "daughter" elements, folks might not understand you! ðŸ˜…)</p>
<h2 id="htmlelements">HTML Elements</h2>
<p>Okay, now that we've learned about the general syntax, I'll come clean - <code>blerp</code>, <code>noodle</code>, <code>aunt</code>, and <code>grandma</code> aren't actual HTML elements.</p>
<p><em>(Technically you could call them anything you want and there wouldn't be any visible errors, but then, more technically, that's no longer HTMLâ€¦ more info here if you're curious: https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/#self-closing-tag)</em></p>
<p>There's a huge selection of HTML element types that all browsers have agreed to accept. Here are just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is Heading 1, for important, very large text.</li>
<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is Paragraph, for your less important and usually smaller size but lengthier text.</li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> apparently comes from "Document Divisions." This is commonly used for organization and visual layout purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>These element types are useful because browsers use this information to understand your website's structure and content. For instance, if you put some text inside of an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, like <code>&lt;h1&gt;Purple Pandas&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, the browser will decide this "Purple Pandas" bit must be <em>really</em> important to your website.</p>
<p>Using the most appropriate element for a specific part of your website is commonly called using "semantic HTML".</p>
<p>This is a <em>very important</em> skill to learn if you want your websites to be found by search engines, accessible to non-sighted and/or keyboard users, and more.</p>
<p>That being said, your website could technically be built only using <code>&lt;blerp&gt;</code> elements and still look the same on the outsideâ€¦</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: Some callback to the dancer's bones. Like maybe you have arm bones in your legs but it looks the same on the outside, you know?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a list of every single element tag in HTML: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element. Warning - there is probably a lot of vocabulary on that site that will look foreign and complicated! Don't worry. Some of these are very obscure, even to experienced developers. 99% of the time, you'll only be using a handful of the most common ones.</p>
<h2 id="selfclosingtags">Self-closing tags</h2>
<p>There are some HTML elements that can't contain children (no text, no elements, no nothin' inside!). In these special cases, you use a slightly different format - almost as if you've merged the opening and closing tags into one.</p>
<p>Correct:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;input /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Incorrect:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
&lt;input&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>These elements are called "void elements", and this specific syntax is called a self-closing tag. More info here: https://www.w3.org/Style/customdtd.en.html</p>
<h2 id="yourfirstrealhtmlwebsite">Your first real HTML website</h2>
<p>Try replacing the code in your <code>.html</code> file now with real elements. Here's a quick cheatsheet of some of the most common elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, â€¦ all the way to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> are for heading text (1 is the most important, 6 is the least)</li>
<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is paragraph text</li>
<li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> adds emphasis</li>
<li><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is a line break (must be self-closing)</li>
<li><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> is a horizontal rule (must be self-closing)</li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is usually for nesting other elements inside</li>
<li><code>&lt;button&gt;</code> is, well, a button</li>
<li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code> is for links (stands for "anchor")</li>
<li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> is for an "unordered list", like a bulleted one</li>
<li><code>&lt;li&gt;</code> is a "list item" and should go specifically inside a <code>ul</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Try combining all of the concepts so far into your file. You could write something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;h1&gt;Funny Cats&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Very funny. Ha ha!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This is a &lt;a&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; about cats that sit in boxes.
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Meow&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;button&gt;View The Cats&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;cat 1&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;meow&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cat 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cat 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we're using real HTML elements, you should see something different in your browser now. Your <code>h1</code> text should look very large and your <code>p</code> quite small in comparison. The <code>button</code> should look like, well, a button! And so on.</p>
<p>Look at you go! This is starting to look like the real thing.</p>
<h2 id="nbaboutspacingindentation">NB: About spacing &amp; indentation</h2>
<p>In some cases, specific spacing is required for things to work. But in a lot of cases, it's just personal preference. For example, these three snippets should all work and look the same in your browser:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;
blah blah text content&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;
  blah blah text content

&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>              &lt;h1&gt;
      blah blah text content
          &lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Programmers like to enforce strict indentation rules (always indent when you move into a child element, etc.) so their code is more legible. Your text editor can even automatically do that for you whenever you save your file*.</p>
<p>That being said, remember that this is a stylistic choice, not a requirement! There's nothing about indentation, spacing, or formatting that makes someone fundamentally a <em>better</em> programmer.</p>
<p>*<em>Search "format on save [your-text-editor's-name]" and you'll likely find steps to turn that on.</em></p>
    
      <h1 id="002">HTML Attributes</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Prerequisites:</h4><ul id="prerequisites"><li><a href="./html-elements-intro.html">HTML Elements</a></li></ul>
      <h2 id="whatarehtmlattributes">What are HTML Attributes?</h2>
<p>So now you've learned a couple ways to write HTML elements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Without text inside:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>With text inside:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;Oh fancy meetin' you here&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>With other elements! and text! inside:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Onions&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They have layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So in simple terms, you know how to either make an empty element, or make one with stuff inside.</p>
<p>Using "attributes" is another way to customize how an element shows up on your website. An "attribute", just as its English meaning implies, is a trait that describes your element, just like you might describe yourself!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: On the left, it's me? Maybe curled up in a ball on my couch with a laptop. On the right it's a plain circle. Then caption each like: Me, "shape": "round", "is-moving": "false" (+ maybe one thats differen)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="howtoapplyattributestoanhtmlelement">How to apply attributes to an HTML element</h2>
<p>There are two parts to each element attribute: the name and the value.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div size="large" mood="happy" x="y"&gt;Text&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The attribute name goes after the element name, with some space in between. Then, add an equals sign, followed by the attribute value, which needs to be in quotations. Finally, you have the angle bracket (<code>&gt;</code>) to close your opening tag, and the closing tag stays the same as before.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can omit the equals sign and quote text. (But you must omit BOTH the equals sign &amp; value; including just one will cause an error). This will save your attribute with its custom name but with no defined value.</p>
<p>Here's a <code>div</code> element with the following information attached: it has an attribute called "size" with a value "large", one called "beautiful" with a value "yes", and two called "easy" and "breezy" with both have no value.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div size="large" easy breezy beautiful="yes"&gt;Text&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Just like <code>div</code> and <code>h1</code> came from a long list of all of the existing HTML element types, there's an even longer list of existing attribute types!</p>
<p>All of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes">these attributes</a> are available on every single HTML element type (although they might be useful on some types).</p>
<p>Each element type has its own unique set of existing attributes as well. For instance, if you look up the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attributes">attributes for <code>img</code></a> - the aptly named "image" element - has a whole bunch of attributes: <code>alt</code>, <code>src</code>, <code>width</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Each of these, when added to an HTML element, gives a specific instruction to the browser on how to interpret that element. There might specific rules to what format each value has to be in, too.</p>
<p>For instance, here I'm setting the <code>src</code> attribute to <a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-146582583-min-1.jpg">this image address</a>. This tells the browser: for this <code>img</code> element, display what's at that link.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img
  src="https://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-146582583-min-1.jpg"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>(Did you notice <code>img</code> is one of those self-closing tags? ðŸ˜›)</p>
<p>Here are a few more realistic examples so you can get used to the syntax.</p>
<p>Setting an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> ("anchor" or link) element specific URL using the <code>href</code> attribute.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;a href="https://butt.com"&gt;What smells?&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Maing an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> (yes, "input") element of <code>type</code> "email".</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;input type="email" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Making that image element show up 500 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img
  width="500"
  height="300"
  src="https://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-146582583-min-1.jpg"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Try these out in your <code>.html</code> file! Here are some practice ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add two different images but make them show up as same exact size. (Tip: To get the web address of an image, try ctrl+clicking an image on a website and hiting "Copy Image Address")</li>
<li>Set up a classic prank by creating an innocent-looking link that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">goes here</a></li>
</ul>

      <h1 id="000">Your First Website</h1>
      <p></p>
      
      <h2 id="whatisawebsite">What is a website?</h2>
<p>A website is the stuff that renders in your web browser. When you open up Chrome, or Firefox, or Netscape Navigator, what you see inside the frame is a website.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: point to the inner frame of a web browser</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="howdoesmycomputerknowwhatstufftoshow">How does my computer know what stuff to show?</h2>
<p>When you go to a web address, it's kind of like making a phone call. You direct your request towards a unique web address (ex. www.duckduckgo.com), just like your call requests a specific phone number. The internet companies involved then do a bunch of work to make sure you see the right website, just like the phone companies do to get your call to the right person.</p>
<p>You could go further to say that seeing the website is like hearing a voicemail. Someone somewhere uploaded an audio file, and that same file gets played to you every time you call. Except in the case of a website, instead of just an audio file, it's usually a combination of a whole bunch of different files.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: process of requesting &amp; receiving website? maybe in parallel with the phone call process?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try downloading this file - <a href="./assets/00/cat.txt">cat.txt</a> - and opening in your browser! You can do this by just manually entering the file's address into your browser, i.e. <code>file:///Users/cha/Desktop/cat.txt</code> instead of where you'd normally write <code>http://www.google.com</code>.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/00/local-url.png" alt="Using a local filepath in your browser" /></p>
<p>If you're not sure what this address would be, don't worry! You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>find the file in your computer's file viewer (ex. Windows Explorer or Mac Finder), right click, and "Open With" the browser of your choice.</li>
<li>or open your browser first, and select the file from there. Ex. in Chrome, you'd need to go to File &gt; Open File.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./assets/00/local-url-open.png" alt="Viewing a local file in your browser" /></p>
<p>Oh hey, look at you! In essence, this is all a website is - files opened in a browser. In this case, it's just a plain text file.</p>
<h2 id="whatiscode">What is code?</h2>
<p>Your file right now is just a plaintext* file. You can tell by the <code>.txt</code> extension at the end.</p>
<p>*<em><code>PlainText</code> is actually the technical term here for the file type, not just a descriptive phrase!</em></p>
<p>Other file types (<code>.html</code>, <code>.js</code>, etc.) contain <strong>code</strong>.</p>
<p>Code is just a set of instructions humans can write for machines to read. Code files also just contain text, but each type has different and very particular rules.</p>
<p>Technically, you can write code on any program* on your computer that lets you write text, like TextEdit or Notepad, as long as you can save the file with the correct extension.</p>
<p><em>*Programs like Microsoft Word save a bunch of other data with your text - formatting, preferences, and other data - which is why they use their own specific <code>.doc</code> or <code>.docx</code> extension on these files. If you open one of these in TextEdit, you'll see a bunch of wacky symbols and whatnot; clearly not human-readable text.</em></p>
<h2 id="howcanamachinereadmyhumaninstructions">How can a machine read my human instructions?</h2>
<p>Think of it like a massive chain of translations. A machine on its own has no understanding of your textual instructions. The ony thing that affects a hunk of metal is whether electricity is flowing (often presented by 1) or not (0). That's where all the memes about hackers using binary (01010111010110100010100101) come from; at the end of the day, that sequence is all the machines understand.</p>
<p>At some point, some human was like, what if we group these signals into unique patterns? 01000001 = A, 01000010 = B, so on and so forth. (These are the real patterns, by the way!)</p>
<p>That way, instead of having to write "010000010100001001000011" every time, you could just write "ABC" and automate the translation - way easier. And then we kept repeating this process.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: like the game of telephone, we're passing a message through multiple layers of translators</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a programming language, then, is just one of these "translation layers". In technical terms, the closer you get to the 0's and 1's side, the "lower level" the language is. A higher level language is more layers away, so it usually feels easier for humans to read and write.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: https://mrgcoding.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/language-spectrum.png maybe some robots/machines at one end &amp; people at the other?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when you learn JavaScript, one of the higher level languages, you can write something as simple and human-legible as <code>var x = 9</code> (setting a variable X to the value 9). It feels almost like magic that the computer can "understand" you, but it's just layers and layers of work from engineers past that you can now build on top of.</p>
<h2 id="howdoicreatethesecodefiles">How do I create these code files?</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, you can technically use any program as long as it can output plain text, like TextEdit or Notepad.</p>
<p>However, it might be useful for you to install a text editing application that is meant specifically for programmers, usually called a "text editor" or "I.D.E." ("Integrated Development Environment"). Most of these programs are free so you can always just download one and replace it later to your preferences.</p>
<p>Here are some free options:</p>

<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Download one of these (or another text editor of your choosing) and you'll be ready to write!</p>
<p>Try opening up your <code>txt</code> file in this text editor. There a lot of different ways to do this (drag the file onto the program icon, use "Open with" again, open it from the text editor via File &gt; Open, etc.) - play around with them and see what's most convenient for you.</p>
<p>Once you have it open, you should be able to edit the text. Write whatever you want in there, hit Save, and refresh your browser - you should see it update to your recent changes.</p>

    &lt;daughter&gt;Shelly&lt;/daughter&gt;
    &lt;daughter&gt;Welly&lt;/daughter&gt;
  &lt;/mom&gt;
  Grandma text #2
  &lt;aunt&gt;
    &lt;cousin&gt;
      &lt;babycousin&gt;Baby text&lt;/babycousin&gt;
    &lt;/cousin&gt;
  &lt;/aunt&gt;
&lt;/grandma&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In our family tree example here, <code>grandma</code> is the "parent" element of <code>mom</code> and <code>aunt</code>, which respectively are "parents" of <code>daughter</code> and <code>cousin</code>. The text inside the elements can also be referred to as their "children". We would even use the term "siblings" to describe the two <code>daughter</code> elements!</p>
<p>(Note: The terms "parent", "child", and "sibling" are actual technical terms that developers use all the time. If you use other, albeit similar, language like "mother" and "daughter" elements, folks might not understand you! ðŸ˜…)</p>
<h2 id="htmlelements">HTML Elements</h2>
<p>Okay, now that we've learned about the general syntax, I'll come clean - <code>blerp</code>, <code>noodle</code>, <code>aunt</code>, and <code>grandma</code> aren't actual HTML elements.</p>
<p><em>(Technically you could call them anything you want and there wouldn't be any visible errors, but then, more technically, that's no longer HTMLâ€¦ more info here if you're curious: https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/#self-closing-tag)</em></p>
<p>There's a huge selection of HTML element types that all browsers have agreed to accept. Here are just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is Heading 1, for important, very large text.</li>
<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is Paragraph, for your less important and usually smaller size but lengthier text.</li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> apparently comes from "Document Divisions." This is commonly used for organization and visual layout purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>These element types are useful because browsers use this information to understand your website's structure and content. For instance, if you put some text inside of an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, like <code>&lt;h1&gt;Purple Pandas&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, the browser will decide this "Purple Pandas" bit must be <em>really</em> important to your website.</p>
<p>Using the most appropriate element for a specific part of your website is commonly called using "semantic HTML".</p>
<p>This is a <em>very important</em> skill to learn if you want your websites to be found by search engines, accessible to non-sighted and/or keyboard users, and more.</p>
<p>That being said, your website could technically be built only using <code>&lt;blerp&gt;</code> elements and still look the same on the outsideâ€¦</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: Some callback to the dancer's bones. Like maybe you have arm bones in your legs but it looks the same on the outside, you know?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a list of every single element tag in HTML: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element. Warning - there is probably a lot of vocabulary on that site that will look foreign and complicated! Don't worry. Some of these are very obscure, even to experienced developers. 99% of the time, you'll only be using a handful of the most common ones.</p>
<h2 id="selfclosingtags">Self-closing tags</h2>
<p>There are some HTML elements that can't contain children (no text, no elements, no nothin' inside!). In these special cases, you use a slightly different format - almost as if you've merged the opening and closing tags into one.</p>
<p>Correct:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;input /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Incorrect:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
&lt;input&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>These elements are called "void elements", and this specific syntax is called a self-closing tag. More info here: https://www.w3.org/Style/customdtd.en.html</p>
<h2 id="yourfirstrealhtmlwebsite">Your first real HTML website</h2>
<p>Try replacing the code in your <code>.html</code> file now with real elements. Here's a quick cheatsheet of some of the most common elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, â€¦ all the way to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> are for heading text (1 is the most important, 6 is the least)</li>
<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is paragraph text</li>
<li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> adds emphasis</li>
<li><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is a line break (must be self-closing)</li>
<li><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> is a horizontal rule (must be self-closing)</li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is usually for nesting other elements inside</li>
<li><code>&lt;button&gt;</code> is, well, a button</li>
<li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code> is for links (stands for "anchor")</li>
<li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> is for an "unordered list", like a bulleted one</li>
<li><code>&lt;li&gt;</code> is a "list item" and should go specifically inside a <code>ul</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Try combining all of the concepts so far into your file. You could write something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;h1&gt;Funny Cats&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Very funny. Ha ha!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This is a &lt;a&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; about cats that sit in boxes.
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Meow&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;button&gt;View The Cats&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;cat 1&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;meow&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cat 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cat 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we're using real HTML elements, you should see something different in your browser now. Your <code>h1</code> text should look very large and your <code>p</code> quite small in comparison. The <code>button</code> should look like, well, a button! And so on.</p>
<p>Look at you go! This is starting to look like the real thing.</p>
<h2 id="nbaboutspacingindentation">NB: About spacing &amp; indentation</h2>
<p>In some cases, specific spacing is required for things to work. But in a lot of cases, it's just personal preference. For example, these three snippets should all work and look the same in your browser:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;
blah blah text content&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;
  blah blah text content

&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>              &lt;h1&gt;
      blah blah text content
          &lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Programmers like to enforce strict indentation rules (always indent when you move into a child element, etc.) so their code is more legible. Your text editor can even automatically do that for you whenever you save your file*.</p>
<p>That being said, remember that this is a stylistic choice, not a requirement! There's nothing about indentation, spacing, or formatting that makes someone fundamentally a <em>better</em> programmer.</p>
<p>*<em>Search "format on save [your-text-editor's-name]" and you'll likely find steps to turn that on.</em></p>
    
      <h1 id="002">HTML Attributes</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Prerequisites:</h4><ul id="prerequisites"><li><a href="./html-elements-intro.html">HTML Elements</a></li></ul>
      <h2 id="whatarehtmlattributes">What are HTML Attributes?</h2>
<p>So now you've learned a couple ways to write HTML elements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Without text inside:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>With text inside:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;Oh fancy meetin' you here&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>With other elements! and text! inside:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Onions&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They have layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So in simple terms, you know how to either make an empty element, or make one with stuff inside.</p>
<p>Using "attributes" is another way to customize how an element shows up on your website. An "attribute", just as its English meaning implies, is a trait that describes your element, just like you might describe yourself!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: On the left, it's me? Maybe curled up in a ball on my couch with a laptop. On the right it's a plain circle. Then caption each like: Me, "shape": "round", "is-moving": "false" (+ maybe one thats differen)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="howtoapplyattributestoanhtmlelement">How to apply attributes to an HTML element</h2>
<p>There are two parts to each element attribute: the name and the value.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div size="large" mood="happy" x="y"&gt;Text&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The attribute name goes after the element name, with some space in between. Then, add an equals sign, followed by the attribute value, which needs to be in quotations. Finally, you have the angle bracket (<code>&gt;</code>) to close your opening tag, and the closing tag stays the same as before.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can omit the equals sign and quote text. (But you must omit BOTH the equals sign &amp; value; including just one will cause an error). This will save your attribute with its custom name but with no defined value.</p>
<p>Here's a <code>div</code> element with the following information attached: it has an attribute called "size" with a value "large", one called "beautiful" with a value "yes", and two called "easy" and "breezy" with both have no value.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div size="large" easy breezy beautiful="yes"&gt;Text&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Just like <code>div</code> and <code>h1</code> came from a long list of all of the existing HTML element types, there's an even longer list of existing attribute types!</p>
<p>All of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes">these attributes</a> are available on every single HTML element type (although they might be useful on some types).</p>
<p>Each element type has its own unique set of existing attributes as well. For instance, if you look up the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attributes">attributes for <code>img</code></a> - the aptly named "image" element - has a whole bunch of attributes: <code>alt</code>, <code>src</code>, <code>width</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Each of these, when added to an HTML element, gives a specific instruction to the browser on how to interpret that element. There might specific rules to what format each value has to be in, too.</p>
<p>For instance, here I'm setting the <code>src</code> attribute to <a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-146582583-min-1.jpg">this image address</a>. This tells the browser: for this <code>img</code> element, display what's at that link.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img
  src="https://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-146582583-min-1.jpg"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>(Did you notice <code>img</code> is one of those self-closing tags? ðŸ˜›)</p>
<p>Here are a few more realistic examples so you can get used to the syntax.</p>
<p>Setting an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> ("anchor" or link) element specific URL using the <code>href</code> attribute.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;a href="https://butt.com"&gt;What smells?&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Maing an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> (yes, "input") element of <code>type</code> "email".</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;input type="email" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Making that image element show up 500 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img
  width="500"
  height="300"
  src="https://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-146582583-min-1.jpg"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Try these out in your <code>.html</code> file! Here are some practice ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add two different images but make them show up as same exact size. (Tip: To get the web address of an image, try ctrl+clicking an image on a website and hiting "Copy Image Address")</li>
<li>Set up a classic prank by creating an innocent-looking link that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">goes here</a></li>
</ul>

      <p></p>
      <h4>Prerequisites:</h4><ul id="prerequisites"><li><a href="./html-attributes-intro.html">HTML Attributes</a></li></ul>
      <h2 id="whatisstyling">What is styling?</h2>
<p>You could certainly build a perfectly functional and useful website just using plain HTML. But if you want to customize the look of it, you'll need to learn about styling.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: functional but drab/default vs functional &amp; looks good? doesn't have to be literal, something fun?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each HTML element in your <code>.html</code> file can have its own unique style.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;Block 1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Block 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Block 3&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If that's all you write in your <code>.html</code> file, your browser will just show three plain lines of text.</p>
<p>But with custom styling, you could put "Block 1" into a blue rectangle with rounded corners and pink text inside. "Block 2" could be jumping up and down, flashing yellow and purple! "Block 3" could always be stuck at the top of the page no matter how much you scroll.</p>
<p>You can style an element's color, positioning, animation, shape, size, and so much more. There are <em>hundreds</em> of traits, called "properties", that you can customize! Just like how <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a specific element name in HTML, these properties belong to another language, called <code>CSS</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some very commonly used CSS properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>color</code> - the color of the text inside the element</li>
<li><code>background-color</code> - the background color of the element</li>
<li><code>font-size</code> - the size of the text inside the element</li>
<li><code>width</code> &amp; <code>height</code> - the width &amp; height of the element</li>
<li>â€¦ and so on!</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these CSS properties has particular rules on what you can set them to. For instance, <code>font-size</code> can take a value like <code>10px</code>, which would make your text 10 pixels tall. You'll encounter an error if you just set it to <code>10</code> though, because as a rule, <code>font-size</code> requires units.</p>
<p>Hundreds of properties - each with their own particular set of rules. Yeah, this is often the most intimidating part of styling.</p>
<p>But don't worry! Learning to code isn't about memorizing everything. In fact, one of the most important skills a programmer can have is being able to search for answers online effectively.</p>
<p>If you forgot how <code>font-size</code> works, for instance, you could search "font-size CSS" and get endless explanations. With common issues, you can likely even search your specific problem, ex. "font-size 10 not working css" and someone on the other side of the globe will have a blog post about it. The beauty of the web!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: Some ridiculously specific question (not web related even) and someone on the other side of the world answering it?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="okaybuthowdoyouaddthesepropertiestoanhtmlelement">Okay, but how do you add these properties to an HTML element?</h2>
<p>We previously learned about HTML attributes and how to use them to save information about a specific element. Like setting an image element's source:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img
  src="https://funnyfoto.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cat-saturday-30-photos-91_07_02_2018.jpg"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>One of most useful attributes is called <code>style</code>. This is one of those "global" attributes - one that is available on every type of HTML element from.</p>
<p>Just like CSS properties, each HTML attribute has specific rules about what kind of values it will accept. The rule with the <code>style</code> attribute is that its value always has to be formatted as CSS code.</p>
<h2 id="letswritesomecss">Let's write some CSS!</h2>
<p>Now that we've gotten comfortable with how to write in the HTML language, it's time to learn another. In CSS, correct syntax looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">color: red;
background-color: blue;
</code></pre>
<p>For each property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property name comes first (always lowercase, never with spaces, dashed between words)</li>
<li>Then a colon (<code>:</code>)</li>
<li>Then the property value</li>
<li>Finally, a semicolon (<code>;</code>) to mark the end of the value</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nbsmallspacingformattingnotes">NB: Small spacing &amp; formatting notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The spaces are not required. Writing the same CSS as <code>color:red;background-color:blue;</code> is completely valid.</li>
<li>Semicolons are required between different properties. Since there's no property following <code>background-color</code>, you technically don't need one there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we just need to take that little chunk of CSS code and set that as the value to a <code>style</code> attribute on one of our HTML elements:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="color: red; background-color: pink;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: yellow;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font-size: 30px;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Try writing similarly styled HTML elements in your <code>.html</code> file. When you view your website (remember, save the file and then refresh your browser!), you should see different colors and font sizes! Hooray!</p>
<h2 id="nbdefaultstyles">NB: Default styles</h2>
<p>HTML elements come with some default styles. Remember how big the <code>h1</code> was in comparison to the <code>p</code> text, even before you added any <code>style</code> attributes? That's because your browser gives <code>h1</code> a default <code>font-size</code> style that is larger than the default of <code>p</code>. And <code>button</code> has a border by default. And so on.</p>
<p>You'll notice that depending on which browser you open up your .<code>html</code> file in, the default styling might also look slightly different. This is because, although the leading browsers have agreed on a lot of things, there are still areas where they diverge.</p>
<p>This is important to know for when your cousin, who still uses Internet Explorer, asks you why your website looks so different on their screen!</p>

      <h2 id="whydoweneedtotalkaboutcolor">Why do we need to talk about color?</h2>
<p>In our previous example, we set the <code>color</code> property (which affects text color) to words like <code>red</code> or <code>blue</code>. There's a long list of these preset colors that browsers will accept. Some of my favorite are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>aliceblue</code></li>
<li><code>firebrick</code></li>
<li><code>papayawhip</code></li>
<li><code>oldlace</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: literal fun mixes with the ones up there? Or any of these work too: https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a joke. Try these colors out and see for yourself!</p>
<p>(Some developers at some point in time were given the power to make up color names, and that's what they came up with.)</p>
<p>Here you can find all 147 predefined color names, or "color keywords", available in CSS: https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords</p>
<p>But wait! Haven't I seen more than 147 colors on the internet? (Also, isn't it ridiculous to type "papayawhip" every time?)</p>
<h2 id="rgbredgreenbluecolor">RGB (Red, Green, Blue) Color</h2>
<p>Any color you see on your computer screen is produced by red, green, and blue lights shining out from it. This mix of color lights then blend together to make your brain think it's actually a single color!</p>
<p>Here's the Wikipedia page how RGB works and where it came from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB<em>color</em>model.</p>
<p>In CSS, the amount of each color light you want is measured from 0 to 255, 0 being none of that light and 255 being the most possible amount. So to specify the specific color you want to make, you have to define these amounts.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> red, <code>0</code> green, and <code>0</code> blue = <strong>black</strong> (no light at all)</li>
<li><code>255</code> red, <code>0</code> green, and <code>0</code> blue = <strong>bright red</strong> (only red light - and the max amount of it)</li>
<li><code>255</code> red, <code>255</code> green, and <code>0</code> blue = <strong>bright yellow</strong> (red + green light)</li>
<li><code>255</code> red, <code>255</code> green, and <code>255</code> blue = <strong>white</strong> (all colors at full blast)</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, to actually use these mini recipes in your code, you'll need the proper syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black: <code>rgb(0,0,0)</code></li>
<li>Bright Red: <code>rgb(255,0,0)</code></li>
<li>Bright Yellow: <code>rgb(255,255,0)</code></li>
<li>White: <code>rgb(255,255,255)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The format you need is <code>rgb</code>, then the color values in order (red, then green, then blue) in parentheses. The numbers must be separated by commas. As seen in some previous CSS, everything must be lowercase.</p>
<h2 id="applyingcolorvaluestostyles">Applying color values to styles</h2>
<p>Now that you know how to code a specific color value, you can use it in your CSS styles!</p>
<p>Previously we were using color shortcuts "red" and "pink":</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="color: red; background-color: pink;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now try putting in your own custom RGB colors!</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="color: rgb(200,120,0); background-color: rgb(90,20,30);"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Do you know what colors these combinations will make? Well, neither can I (besides some educated guesses). Don't worry about having to memorize these numbers or even being able to know what color they are at a glance. There are so many tools that will do this for you!</p>
<h2 id="hexcolors">Hex Colors</h2>
<p>You can also format RGB colors as "hexadecimal" numbers, often called "hex codes" or "hex colors". It's the same concept - three numbers for red, green, and blue amounts - just formatted differently:</p>
<pre><code>#ae13f4
</code></pre>
<p>That probably looks confusing. Let's break it down. The <code>#</code> at the beginning is a required prefix to indicate you're using a hex code. This will be the same for every color. Then a code of exactly 6 characters.[^1]</p>
<p>These 6 characters are actually 3 pairs; the first two represent the R (red) amount, the next two are for G (green), and finally the last two are for B (blue). Believe it or not, each of these pairs still just translates to a number from 0 to 25!</p>
<pre><code>Red amount:   ae = 174
Green amount: 13 = 19
Blue amount:  f4 = 244
</code></pre>
<p>So that means these should look exactly the same:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: rgb(174,19,244);"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: #ae13f4;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Confused? The reason you see letters and numbers is because we're counting in base 16.</p>
<p>Usually we count in base 10 using the numbers 0 - 9. In base 16, you need 16 digits instead of 10. Since those numbers don't exist in our day-to-day usage, we pull in letters: 0 - 9, then a - f. (More info: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)</p>
<pre><code>Hexadecimal (Base 16): 0 1 2 ... 8 9 a  b  c  d  e  f
"Normal" (Base 10):    0 1 2 ... 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
</code></pre>
<p>The highest possible number using only two digits is <code>ff</code>, which, not coincidentally, is the equivalent of <code>255</code> - sound familiar?</p>
<h2 id="alltogethernow">All together now!</h2>
<p>Now you've learned three different ways to format a color value in CSS. These three blocks should all look identical:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: black;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: rgb(0,0,0);"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And so should these:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: red;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0);"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: #ff0000;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You'll see all three types used very commonly, so it's important to be able to recognize and understand them all. In your own use, choose whatever feels more comfortable for each case.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
<p>[^1]: You might discover, by accident or otherwise, that a 3-character hex code (ex. <code>#fff</code>) also works. This format is sometimes used as a shorthand when all three (R, G, and B) hexadecimal numbers are doubles of the same character. Ex. <code>#f0a</code> actually denotes <code>#ff00aa</code>, <code>#b9c</code> is <code>#bb99cc</code>, etc.</p>

      <h2 id="whatisstyling">What is styling?</h2>
<p>You could certainly build a perfectly functional and useful website just using plain HTML. But if you want to customize the look of it, you'll need to learn about styling.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: functional but drab/default vs functional &amp; looks good? doesn't have to be literal, something fun?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each HTML element in your <code>.html</code> file can have its own unique style.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;Block 1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Block 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Block 3&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If that's all you write in your <code>.html</code> file, your browser will just show three plain lines of text.</p>
<p>But with custom styling, you could put "Block 1" into a blue rectangle with rounded corners and pink text inside. "Block 2" could be jumping up and down, flashing yellow and purple! "Block 3" could always be stuck at the top of the page no matter how much you scroll.</p>
<p>You can style an element's color, positioning, animation, shape, size, and so much more. There are <em>hundreds</em> of traits, called "properties", that you can customize! Just like how <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a specific element name in HTML, these properties belong to another language, called <code>CSS</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some very commonly used CSS properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>color</code> - the color of the text inside the element</li>
<li><code>background-color</code> - the background color of the element</li>
<li><code>font-size</code> - the size of the text inside the element</li>
<li><code>width</code> &amp; <code>height</code> - the width &amp; height of the element</li>
<li>â€¦ and so on!</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these CSS properties has particular rules on what you can set them to. For instance, <code>font-size</code> can take a value like <code>10px</code>, which would make your text 10 pixels tall. You'll encounter an error if you just set it to <code>10</code> though, because as a rule, <code>font-size</code> requires units.</p>
<p>Hundreds of properties - each with their own particular set of rules. Yeah, this is often the most intimidating part of styling.</p>
<p>But don't worry! Learning to code isn't about memorizing everything. In fact, one of the most important skills a programmer can have is being able to search for answers online effectively.</p>
<p>If you forgot how <code>font-size</code> works, for instance, you could search "font-size CSS" and get endless explanations. With common issues, you can likely even search your specific problem, ex. "font-size 10 not working css" and someone on the other side of the globe will have a blog post about it. The beauty of the web!</p>

<h2 id="okaybuthowdoyouaddthesepropertiestoanhtmlelement">Okay, but how do you add these properties to an HTML element?</h2>
<p>We previously learned about HTML attributes and how to use them to save information about a specific element. Like setting an image element's source:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img
  src="https://funnyfoto.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cat-saturday-30-photos-91_07_02_2018.jpg"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>One of most useful attributes is called <code>style</code>. This is one of those "global" attributes - one that is available on every type of HTML element from.</p>
<p>Just like CSS properties, each HTML attribute has specific rules about what kind of values it will accept. The rule with the <code>style</code> attribute is that its value always has to be formatted as CSS code.</p>
<h2 id="letswritesomecss">Let's write some CSS!</h2>
<p>Now that we've gotten comfortable with how to write in the HTML language, it's time to learn another. In CSS, correct syntax looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">color: red;
background-color: blue;
</code></pre>
<p>For each property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property name comes first (always lowercase, never with spaces, dashed between words)</li>
<li>Then a colon (<code>:</code>)</li>
<li>Then the property value</li>
<li>Finally, a semicolon (<code>;</code>) to mark the end of the value</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nbsmallspacingformattingnotes">NB: Small spacing &amp; formatting notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The spaces are not required. Writing the same CSS as <code>color:red;background-color:blue;</code> is completely valid.</li>
<li>Semicolons are required between different properties. Since there's no property following <code>background-color</code>, you technically don't need one there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we just need to take that little chunk of CSS code and set that as the value to a <code>style</code> attribute on one of our HTML elements:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="color: red; background-color: pink;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: yellow;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font-size: 30px;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Try writing similarly styled HTML elements in your <code>.html</code> file. When you view your website (remember, save the file and then refresh your browser!), you should see different colors and font sizes! Hooray!</p>
<h2 id="nbdefaultstyles">NB: Default styles</h2>
<p>HTML elements come with some default styles. Remember how big the <code>h1</code> was in comparison to the <code>p</code> text, even before you added any <code>style</code> attributes? That's because your browser gives <code>h1</code> a default <code>font-size</code> style that is larger than the default of <code>p</code>. And <code>button</code> has a border by default. And so on.</p>
<p>You'll notice that depending on which browser you open up your .<code>html</code> file in, the default styling might also look slightly different. This is because, although the leading browsers have agreed on a lot of things, there are still areas where they diverge.</p>
<p>This is important to know for when your cousin, who still uses Internet Explorer, asks you why your website looks so different on their screen!</p>

      <h2 id="whydoweneedtotalkaboutcolor">Why do we need to talk about color?</h2>
<p>In our previous example, we set the <code>color</code> property (which affects text color) to words like <code>red</code> or <code>blue</code>. There's a long list of these preset colors that browsers will accept. Some of my favorite are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>aliceblue</code></li>
<li><code>firebrick</code></li>
<li><code>papayawhip</code></li>
<li><code>oldlace</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: literal fun mixes with the ones up there? Or any of these work too: https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a joke. Try these colors out and see for yourself!</p>
<p>(Some developers at some point in time were given the power to make up color names, and that's what they came up with.)</p>
<p>Here you can find all 147 predefined color names, or "color keywords", available in CSS: https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords</p>
<p>But wait! Haven't I seen more than 147 colors on the internet? (Also, isn't it ridiculous to type "papayawhip" every time?)</p>
<h2 id="rgbredgreenbluecolor">RGB (Red, Green, Blue) Color</h2>
<p>Any color you see on your computer screen is produced by red, green, and blue lights shining out from it. This mix of color lights then blend together to make your brain think it's actually a single color!</p>
<p>Here's the Wikipedia page how RGB works and where it came from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB<em>color</em>model.</p>
<p>In CSS, the amount of each color light you want is measured from 0 to 255, 0 being none of that light and 255 being the most possible amount. So to specify the specific color you want to make, you have to define these amounts.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> red, <code>0</code> green, and <code>0</code> blue = <strong>black</strong> (no light at all)</li>
<li><code>255</code> red, <code>0</code> green, and <code>0</code> blue = <strong>bright red</strong> (only red light - and the max amount of it)</li>
<li><code>255</code> red, <code>255</code> green, and <code>0</code> blue = <strong>bright yellow</strong> (red + green light)</li>
<li><code>255</code> red, <code>255</code> green, and <code>255</code> blue = <strong>white</strong> (all colors at full blast)</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, to actually use these mini recipes in your code, you'll need the proper syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black: <code>rgb(0,0,0)</code></li>
<li>Bright Red: <code>rgb(255,0,0)</code></li>
<li>Bright Yellow: <code>rgb(255,255,0)</code></li>
<li>White: <code>rgb(255,255,255)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The format you need is <code>rgb</code>, then the color values in order (red, then green, then blue) in parentheses. The numbers must be separated by commas. As seen in some previous CSS, everything must be lowercase.</p>
<h2 id="applyingcolorvaluestostyles">Applying color values to styles</h2>
<p>Now that you know how to code a specific color value, you can use it in your CSS styles!</p>
<p>Previously we were using color shortcuts "red" and "pink":</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="color: red; background-color: pink;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now try putting in your own custom RGB colors!</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="color: rgb(200,120,0); background-color: rgb(90,20,30);"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Do you know what colors these combinations will make? Well, neither can I (besides some educated guesses). Don't worry about having to memorize these numbers or even being able to know what color they are at a glance. There are so many tools that will do this for you!</p>
<h2 id="hexcolors">Hex Colors</h2>
<p>You can also format RGB colors as "hexadecimal" numbers, often called "hex codes" or "hex colors". It's the same concept - three numbers for red, green, and blue amounts - just formatted differently:</p>
<pre><code>#ae13f4
</code></pre>
<p>That probably looks confusing. Let's break it down. The <code>#</code> at the beginning is a required prefix to indicate you're using a hex code. This will be the same for every color. Then a code of exactly 6 characters.[^1]</p>
<p>These 6 characters are actually 3 pairs; the first two represent the R (red) amount, the next two are for G (green), and finally the last two are for B (blue). Believe it or not, each of these pairs still just translates to a number from 0 to 25!</p>
<pre><code>Red amount:   ae = 174
Green amount: 13 = 19
Blue amount:  f4 = 244
</code></pre>
<p>So that means these should look exactly the same:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: rgb(174,19,244);"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: #ae13f4;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Confused? The reason you see letters and numbers is because we're counting in base 16.</p>
<p>Usually we count in base 10 using the numbers 0 - 9. In base 16, you need 16 digits instead of 10. Since those numbers don't exist in our day-to-day usage, we pull in letters: 0 - 9, then a - f. (More info: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)</p>
<pre><code>Hexadecimal (Base 16): 0 1 2 ... 8 9 a  b  c  d  e  f
"Normal" (Base 10):    0 1 2 ... 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
</code></pre>
<p>The highest possible number using only two digits is <code>ff</code>, which, not coincidentally, is the equivalent of <code>255</code> - sound familiar?</p>
<h2 id="alltogethernow">All together now!</h2>
<p>Now you've learned three different ways to format a color value in CSS. These three blocks should all look identical:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: black;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: rgb(0,0,0);"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And so should these:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: red;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0);"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: #ff0000;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You'll see all three types used very commonly, so it's important to be able to recognize and understand them all. In your own use, choose whatever feels more comfortable for each case.</p>
