        What is a Website?
      </h1>
      <p></p>
      
      <p>A website is literally a location - a "site" - on the internet. You can view that location through a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Netscape Navigator), and what you see when it loads up is a representation of that website.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/00/website-anatomy.png" alt="Pointing to a website, which is the content rendered by a browser." /></p>
<h2 id="howdoesmycomputerknowwhatstufftoshow">How does my computer know what stuff to show?</h2>
<p>When you use a web address, it's kind of like making a phone call. You direct your request towards a unique web address (like "www.duckduckgo.com"), just like your call requests a specific phone number. The internet companies involved then do a bunch of work to make sure you see the right website.</p>
<p>You could go further to say that seeing the website is like hearing a voicemail. Someone somewhere uploaded an audio file, and that same file gets played to you every time you call. Except, in the case of a website,it's usually a combination of a whole bunch of different files instead of just one audio file.</p>
<!-- > ILLUSTRATION: process of requesting & receiving website? maybe in parallel with the phone call process? -->
<h2 id="usingyourownfiles">Using your own files</h2>
<p>Click to download this file: <a href="data:text/plain;charset=UTF-8,Meow! I am a cat! üê±" download="cat.txt">cat.txt</a>. It should just be a plain text file with some words inside.</p>
<p>Now, try opening it in your browser! You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>find the file in your computer's file viewer (ex. Windows Explorer or Mac Finder), right click, and "Open With" the browser of your choice.</li>
<li>or open your browser first, and select the file from there. (For example in Chrome, you'd need to go to File &gt; Open File.)</li>
</ul>
<!-- ![Using a local filepath in your browser](./assets/00/local-url.png) -->
<p>Now you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/00/local-url-open.png" alt="Viewing a local file in your browser" /></p>
<p>Amazing! In essence, this is all a website is: files at a specific location (in this case, just on your computer somewhere) opened in a browser.</p>
<h2 id="quickdivefilepaths">Quick Dive: Filepaths</h2>
<p>The action above of "opening a file" in your browser is just a shortcut. What it's actually doing is manually entering your file's exact location (the thing that looks similar to <code>/Users/cha/Desktop/cat.txt</code>) into the address bar (where you'd normally write something like <code>www.ebay.com</code>).</p>
<p>That bit of text describing the file's location is called the <code>filepath</code> - since it's quite literally the "path" you need to take to find the file.</p>
<p>In this case, my file is in a folder called "Desktop" inside a folder called "cha" inside a folder called "Users."</p>
<h2 id="whatiscode">What is code?</h2>
<p>Your file right now is just a plaintext* file. You can tell by the <code>.txt</code> extension at the end.</p>
<p>*<em><code>plaintext</code> is actually the technical term here for the file type, not just a descriptive phrase!</em></p>
<p>Other file types (<code>.html</code>, <code>.js</code>, etc.) contain <strong>code</strong>.</p>
<p>Code is just a set of instructions humans can write for machines to read. Code files also just contain text, but each type has different and very particular rules.</p>
<p>Technically, you can write code on any program* on your computer that lets you write text, like TextEdit or Notepad, as long as you can save the file with the correct extension.</p>
<p><em>*Programs like Microsoft Word save a bunch of other data with your text - formatting, preferences, and other data - which is why they use their own specific <code>.doc</code> or <code>.docx</code> extension on these files. If you open one of these in TextEdit, you'll see a bunch of wacky symbols and whatnot; clearly not human-readable text.</em></p>
<h2 id="howcanamachinereadmyhumaninstructions">How can a machine read my human instructions?</h2>
<p>Think of it like a massive chain of translations. A machine on its own has no understanding of your textual instructions. The only thing that affects a hunk of metal is whether electricity is flowing (often presented by 1) or not (0). That's where all the memes about hackers using binary (01010111010110100010100101) come from; at the end of the day, that sequence is all the machines understand.</p>
<p>At some point, some human was like, what if we group these signals into unique patterns? 01000001 = A, 01000010 = B, so on and so forth. (These are the real patterns, by the way!)</p>
<p>That way, instead of having to write "010000010100001001000011" every time, you could just write "ABC" and automate the translation - way easier. And then we kept repeating this process.</p>
<!-- > ILLUSTRATION: like the game of telephone, we're passing a message through multiple layers of translators -->
<p>So a "programming language", then, is just one of these translation layers. In technical terms, the closer you get to the 0's and 1's side, the "lower level" the language is. A higher level language is more layers away, so it usually feels easier for humans to read and write.</p>
<!-- > ILLUSTRATION: https://mrgcoding.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/language-spectrum.png maybe some robots/machines at one end & people at the other? -->
<p>So when you learn JavaScript, one of the higher level languages, you can write something as simple and human-legible as <code>var x = 9</code> (setting a variable X to the value 9). It feels almost like magic that the computer can "understand" you, but it's just layers and layers of work from engineers past that you can now build on top of.</p>
<h2 id="howdoicreatethesecodefiles">How do I create these code files?</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, you can technically use any program as long as it can output plain text, like TextEdit or Notepad.</p>
<p>However, it might be useful for you to install a text editing application that is meant specifically for programmers, usually called a "text editor" or "I.D.E." ("Integrated Development Environment", with the acronym usually pronounced as individual letters). These applications have built-in tools specifically for coding, and can be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>Most of these programs are free so you can always just download one and replace it later to your preferences.</p>
<p>Here are some free options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a></li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Download one of these (or another text editor of your choosing) and you'll be ready to write!</p>
<p>Here's <a href="text-editor-basics.html">a bit more guidance about how to use it effectively</a>.</p>
<p><em>(Some developers can be a bit evangelical on this subject - I suggest you kindly ignore them and choose whatever you like best, for whatever reason. Just for reference, I started with Sublime, moved to Atom next, and currently use VS Code.)</em></p>
<p>Try opening up your <code>txt</code> file in this text editor. There a lot of different ways to do this (drag the file onto the program icon, use "Open with" again, open it from the text editor via File &gt; Open, etc.) - play around with them and see what's most convenient for you.</p>
<p>Once you have it open, you should be able to edit the text. Write whatever you want in there, hit Save, and refresh the browser tab where it's open - you should see it immediately update to your recent changes.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you're editing your first website! ‚ú®</p>

        HTML Elements
      </h1>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Prerequisites:</h4><ul id="prerequisites"><li><a href="./what-is-a-website.html">What is a Website?</a></li></ul>
      <h2 id="whatishtmlandwhyarewestartingwithit">What is HTML, and why are we starting with it?</h2>
<p>HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language." If you want to make sense of this acronym, it's a programming language that "marks up", or describes the structure of, "hypertext" - content on the web. But for everyday use, we just call it HTML (pronounced letter-by-letter).</p>
<p>Imagine that your website is a dancer. One day, we want them to perform beautiful choreography! In magnificent costume! But before we design a skirt or direct steps, we have to make some legs first. And that type of structure can be created with HTML.</p>
<!-- > ILLUSTRATION: I mean, I think you get the point here >.< -->
<h2 id="creatinganhtmlfile">Creating an HTML file</h2>
<p>So far, we've only used a plain text file (<code>.txt</code>). Now, let's make our first HTML file.</p>
<p>You can either create a new file or just rename the existing file from <code>cat.txt</code> to <code>cat.html</code> to get started. You can do this in countless ways, but here are some options to be extra clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>File &gt; Save As...</code> to make a copy, and manually change the <code>.txt</code> ending to <code>.html</code></li>
<li><code>File &gt; New</code> to create a new untitled file, then <code>File &gt; Save</code> or <code>cmd/ctrl+S</code> to give it a name (ending in <code>.html</code>)</li>
<li>Ctrl+click the file in your text editor's side bar, or your computer's file viewer and select "Rename"</li>
</ul>
<p>Whichever way you choose, the important bit is to end up with a file named something with <code>.html</code> at the end to indicate it's going to be filled with HTML code. Open it up in your <a href="what-is-a-website.html#howdoicreatethesecodefiles">text editor</a>, and let's write!</p>
<h2 id="howtowritehtml">How to write HTML</h2>
<p>In HTML, things are broken down into elements. (You might also hear them called "blocks" or "tags".) Each HTML element looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>[1]       [2]       [3]
&lt;element&gt; some text &lt;/element&gt;
</code></pre>
<!-- > ILLUSTRATION: Some illustration of the HTML structure as written above? With little arrows pointing to the pieces maybe? -->
<p>Each element is indicated by two "tags" (1 &amp; 3), and you can put text between them (2). Each tag is surrounded by brackets <code>&lt;beep&gt;</code> but only the second one has the slash <code>&lt;/beep&gt;</code> so you know where it ends.</p>
<p>The element type is specified inside of the angle brackets.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;beep&gt;Text&lt;/beep&gt;&lt;boop&gt;More Text&lt;/boop&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, you might refer to these as "beep" and "boop" elements. One <code>beep</code> element with "Text" inside it, and one <code>boop</code> element with "More Text" inside it.</p>
<p>Try typing these elements in your <code>.html</code> file. Make your own! Move them around! Type funny quotes inside them! Save your changes, and view the file in your browser again.</p>
<p>Notice that you won't see the element tags, like <code>&lt;beep&gt;</code>, in your browser - you only see the text (<code>Text</code> and <code>More Text</code>) you put inside them. This is exactly how all HTML elements work; they simply provide the underlying structure for your content.</p>
<h2 id="nesting">Nesting</h2>
<p>You can also "nest" elements inside one another, with or without text, to produce more complex structures. "Nesting" is a very common concept across programming, not just in HTML. These relationships are often described as "parent" and "child" - in this case, the elements inside are "children", wrapped by their "parent" element.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;grandma&gt;
  Grandma text #1
  &lt;mom&gt;
    &lt;daughter&gt;Shelly&lt;/daughter&gt;
    &lt;daughter&gt;Kelly&lt;/daughter&gt;
  &lt;/mom&gt;
  Grandma text #2
  &lt;aunt&gt;
    &lt;cousin&gt;
      &lt;babycousin&gt;Baby text&lt;/babycousin&gt;
    &lt;/cousin&gt;
  &lt;/aunt&gt;
&lt;/grandma&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In our family tree example here, <code>grandma</code> is the "parent" element of <code>mom</code> and <code>aunt</code>, which respectively are "parents" of <code>daughter</code> and <code>cousin</code>. The text inside the elements can also be referred to as their "children". We would even use the term "siblings" to describe the two <code>daughter</code> elements!</p>
<p><em>(Note: The terms "parent", "child", and "sibling" are actual technical terms that developers use all the time. If you use other, albeit similar, language like "mother" and "daughter" elements, folks might not understand you!)</em></p>
<h2 id="actualhtmlelements">Actual HTML Elements</h2>
<p>Okay, now that we've learned about the general syntax, I'll come clean - <code>beep</code>, <code>boop</code>, <code>aunt</code>, and <code>grandma</code> aren't <em>real</em> HTML elements.</p>
<p><em>(Technically you could call them anything you want and there wouldn't be any visible errors, but then, more technically, that's no longer HTML‚Ä¶ <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/#self-closing-tag">more info here</a> if you're curious.)</em></p>
<p>There's a huge selection of HTML element types that all browsers have agreed to accept. Here are just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is Heading 1, for important, very large text.</li>
<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is Paragraph, for your less important and usually smaller size but lengthier text.</li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> apparently comes from "Document Divisions." This is commonly used for organization and visual layout purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>These element types are useful because browsers use this information to understand your website's structure and content. For instance, if you put some text inside of an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, like <code>&lt;h1&gt;Purple Pandas&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, the browser will decide this "Purple Pandas" bit must be <em>really</em> important to your website.</p>
<p>Using the most appropriate element for a specific part of your website is commonly called using "semantic HTML".</p>
<p>This is a <em>very important</em> skill to learn if you want your websites to be found by search engines, accessible to non-sighted and/or keyboard users, and more.</p>
<p>That being said, your website could technically be built only using <code>&lt;boop&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;beep&gt;</code> elements and still look the same on the outside‚Ä¶</p>
<!-- > ILLUSTRATION: Some callback to the dancer's bones. Like maybe you have arm bones in your legs but it looks the same on the outside, you know? -->
<p>Here's a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">list of every single element tag in HTML</a>. Warning - there is probably a lot of vocabulary on that site that will look foreign and complicated! Don't worry. Some of these are very obscure, even to experienced developers. 99% of the time, you'll only be using a handful of the most common ones.</p>
<h2 id="selfclosingtags">Self-closing tags</h2>
<p>There are some HTML elements that can't contain children (no text, no elements, no nothin' inside!). In these special cases, you use a slightly different format - almost as if you've merged the opening and closing tags into one.</p>
<p>Correct:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;input /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Incorrect:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
&lt;input&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>These elements are called "void elements", and this specific syntax is called a self-closing tag. <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/customdtd.en.html">More info here.</a></p>
<h2 id="yourfirstrealhtmlwebsite">Your first real HTML website</h2>
<p>Try replacing the code in your <code>.html</code> file now with real elements. Here's a quick cheatsheet of some of the most common elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, ‚Ä¶ all the way to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> are for heading text (1 is the most important, 6 is the least)</li>
<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is paragraph text</li>
<li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> adds emphasis</li>
<li><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is a line break (must be self-closing)</li>
<li><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> is a horizontal rule (must be self-closing)</li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is usually for nesting other elements inside</li>
<li><code>&lt;button&gt;</code> is, well, a button</li>
<li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code> is for links (stands for "anchor")</li>
<li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> is for an "unordered list", like a bulleted one</li>
<li><code>&lt;li&gt;</code> is a "list item" and should go specifically inside a <code>ul</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Try combining all of the concepts so far into your file. Come up with your own structure and content! For reference, here's what your editor might look like at this point:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/00/html-example.png" alt="A screenshot of my text editor, with a bunch of html elements written into a file." /></p>
<p>Now that we're using real HTML elements, you should see something different in your browser now. Your <code>h1</code> text should look very large and your <code>p</code> quite small in comparison. The <code>button</code> should look like, well, a button! And so on.</p>
<p>When I save that file and view it in my browser, it looks like this now:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/00/html-example-output.png" alt="The browser output of the example html." /></p>
<p>I mean, that's a pretty cool website, right?</p>
<h2 id="nbaboutspacingindentation">NB: About spacing &amp; indentation</h2>
<p>In some cases, specific spacing is required for things to work. But in a lot of cases, it's just personal preference. For example, these three snippets should all work and look the same in your browser:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;
blah blah text content&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;
  blah blah text content

&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>              &lt;h1&gt;
      blah blah text content
          &lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Programmers like to enforce strict indentation rules (always indent when you move into a child element, etc.) so their code is more legible. Your text editor can even <a href="text-editor-basics.html#savingyourfiles">automatically do that for you whenever you save your file</a>. for convenience.</p>
<p>That being said, remember that this is a stylistic choice, not a requirement! There's nothing about indentation, spacing, or formatting that makes someone fundamentally a <em>better</em> programmer.</p>

<p>That way, instead of having to write "010000010100001001000011" every time, you could just write "ABC" and automate the translation - way easier. And then we kept repeating this process.</p>
<!-- > ILLUSTRATION: like the game of telephone, we're passing a message through multiple layers of translators -->
<p>So a "programming language", then, is just one of these translation layers. In technical terms, the closer you get to the 0's and 1's side, the "lower level" the language is. A higher level language is more layers away, so it usually feels easier for humans to read and write.</p>
<!-- > ILLUSTRATION: https://mrgcoding.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/language-spectrum.png maybe some robots/machines at one end & people at the other? -->
<p>So when you learn JavaScript, one of the higher level languages, you can write something as simple and human-legible as <code>var x = 9</code> (setting a variable X to the value 9). It feels almost like magic that the computer can "understand" you, but it's just layers and layers of work from engineers past that you can now build on top of.</p>
<h2 id="howdoicreatethesecodefiles">How do I create these code files?</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, you can technically use any program as long as it can output plain text, like TextEdit or Notepad.</p>
<p>However, it might be useful for you to install a text editing application that is meant specifically for programmers, usually called a "text editor" or "I.D.E." ("Integrated Development Environment", with the acronym usually pronounced as individual letters). These applications have built-in tools specifically for coding, and can be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>Most of these programs are free so you can always just download one and replace it later to your preferences.</p>
<p>Here are some free options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a></li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Download one of these (or another text editor of your choosing) and you'll be ready to write!</p>
<p>Here's <a href="text-editor-basics.html">a bit more guidance about how to use it effectively</a>.</p>
<p><em>(Some developers can be a bit evangelical on this subject - I suggest you kindly ignore them and choose whatever you like best, for whatever reason. Just for reference, I started with Sublime, moved to Atom next, and currently use VS Code.)</em></p>
<p>Try opening up your <code>txt</code> file in this text editor. There a lot of different ways to do this (drag the file onto the program icon, use "Open with" again, open it from the text editor via File &gt; Open, etc.) - play around with them and see what's most convenient for you.</p>
<p>Once you have it open, you should be able to edit the text. Write whatever you want in there, hit Save, and refresh the browser tab where it's open - you should see it immediately update to your recent changes.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you're editing your first website! ‚ú®</p>

        HTML Elements
      </h1>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Prerequisites:</h4><ul id="prerequisites"><li><a href="./what-is-a-website.html">What is a Website?</a></li></ul>
      <h2 id="whatishtmlandwhyarewestartingwithit">What is HTML, and why are we starting with it?</h2>
<p>HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language." If you want to make sense of this acronym, it's a programming language that "marks up", or describes the structure of, "hypertext" - content on the web. But for everyday use, we just call it HTML (pronounced letter-by-letter).</p>
<p>Imagine that your website is a dancer. One day, we want them to perform beautiful choreography! In magnificent costume! But before we design a skirt or direct steps, we have to make some legs first. And that type of structure can be created with HTML.</p>
<!-- > ILLUSTRATION: I mean, I think you get the point here >.< -->
<h2 id="creatinganhtmlfile">Creating an HTML file</h2>
<p>So far, we've only used a plain text file (<code>.txt</code>). Now, let's make our first HTML file.</p>
<p>You can either create a new file or just rename the existing file from <code>cat.txt</code> to <code>cat.html</code> to get started. You can do this in countless ways, but here are some options to be extra clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>File &gt; Save As...</code> to make a copy, and manually change the <code>.txt</code> ending to <code>.html</code></li>
<li><code>File &gt; New</code> to create a new untitled file, then <code>File &gt; Save</code> or <code>cmd/ctrl+S</code> to give it a name (ending in <code>.html</code>)</li>
<li>Ctrl+click the file in your text editor's side bar, or your computer's file viewer and select "Rename"</li>
</ul>
<p>Whichever way you choose, the important bit is to end up with a file named something with <code>.html</code> at the end to indicate it's going to be filled with HTML code. Open it up in your <a href="what-is-a-website.html#howdoicreatethesecodefiles">text editor</a>, and let's write!</p>
<h2 id="howtowritehtml">How to write HTML</h2>
<p>In HTML, things are broken down into elements. (You might also hear them called "blocks" or "tags".) Each HTML element looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>[1]       [2]       [3]
&lt;element&gt; some text &lt;/element&gt;
</code></pre>
<!-- > ILLUSTRATION: Some illustration of the HTML structure as written above? With little arrows pointing to the pieces maybe? -->
<p>Each element is indicated by two "tags" (1 &amp; 3), and you can put text between them (2). Each tag is surrounded by brackets <code>&lt;beep&gt;</code> but only the second one has the slash <code>&lt;/beep&gt;</code> so you know where it ends.</p>
<p>The element type is specified inside of the angle brackets.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;beep&gt;Text&lt;/beep&gt;&lt;boop&gt;More Text&lt;/boop&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, you might refer to these as "beep" and "boop" elements. One <code>beep</code> element with "Text" inside it, and one <code>boop</code> element with "More Text" inside it.</p>
<p>Try typing these elements in your <code>.html</code> file. Make your own! Move them around! Type funny quotes inside them! Save your changes, and view the file in your browser again.</p>
<p>Notice that you won't see the element tags, like <code>&lt;beep&gt;</code>, in your browser - you only see the text (<code>Text</code> and <code>More Text</code>) you put inside them. This is exactly how all HTML elements work; they simply provide the underlying structure for your content.</p>
<h2 id="nesting">Nesting</h2>
<p>You can also "nest" elements inside one another, with or without text, to produce more complex structures. "Nesting" is a very common concept across programming, not just in HTML. These relationships are often described as "parent" and "child" - in this case, the elements inside are "children", wrapped by their "parent" element.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;grandma&gt;
  Grandma text #1
  &lt;mom&gt;
    &lt;daughter&gt;Shelly&lt;/daughter&gt;
    &lt;daughter&gt;Kelly&lt;/daughter&gt;
  &lt;/mom&gt;
  Grandma text #2
  &lt;aunt&gt;
    &lt;cousin&gt;
      &lt;babycousin&gt;Baby text&lt;/babycousin&gt;
    &lt;/cousin&gt;
  &lt;/aunt&gt;
&lt;/grandma&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In our family tree example here, <code>grandma</code> is the "parent" element of <code>mom</code> and <code>aunt</code>, which respectively are "parents" of <code>daughter</code> and <code>cousin</code>. The text inside the elements can also be referred to as their "children". We would even use the term "siblings" to describe the two <code>daughter</code> elements!</p>
<p><em>(Note: The terms "parent", "child", and "sibling" are actual technical terms that developers use all the time. If you use other, albeit similar, language like "mother" and "daughter" elements, folks might not understand you!)</em></p>
<h2 id="actualhtmlelements">Actual HTML Elements</h2>
<p>Okay, now that we've learned about the general syntax, I'll come clean - <code>beep</code>, <code>boop</code>, <code>aunt</code>, and <code>grandma</code> aren't <em>real</em> HTML elements.</p>
<p><em>(Technically you could call them anything you want and there wouldn't be any visible errors, but then, more technically, that's no longer HTML‚Ä¶ <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/#self-closing-tag">more info here</a> if you're curious.)</em></p>
<p>There's a huge selection of HTML element types that all browsers have agreed to accept. Here are just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is Heading 1, for important, very large text.</li>
<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is Paragraph, for your less important and usually smaller size but lengthier text.</li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> apparently comes from "Document Divisions." This is commonly used for organization and visual layout purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>These element types are useful because browsers use this information to understand your website's structure and content. For instance, if you put some text inside of an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, like <code>&lt;h1&gt;Purple Pandas&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, the browser will decide this "Purple Pandas" bit must be <em>really</em> important to your website.</p>
<p>Using the most appropriate element for a specific part of your website is commonly called using "semantic HTML".</p>
<p>This is a <em>very important</em> skill to learn if you want your websites to be found by search engines, accessible to non-sighted and/or keyboard users, and more.</p>
<p>That being said, your website could technically be built only using <code>&lt;boop&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;beep&gt;</code> elements and still look the same on the outside‚Ä¶</p>
<!-- > ILLUSTRATION: Some callback to the dancer's bones. Like maybe you have arm bones in your legs but it looks the same on the outside, you know? -->
<p>Here's a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">list of every single element tag in HTML</a>. Warning - there is probably a lot of vocabulary on that site that will look foreign and complicated! Don't worry. Some of these are very obscure, even to experienced developers. 99% of the time, you'll only be using a handful of the most common ones.</p>
<h2 id="selfclosingtags">Self-closing tags</h2>
<p>There are some HTML elements that can't contain children (no text, no elements, no nothin' inside!). In these special cases, you use a slightly different format - almost as if you've merged the opening and closing tags into one.</p>
<p>Correct:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;input /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Incorrect:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
&lt;input&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>These elements are called "void elements", and this specific syntax is called a self-closing tag. <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/customdtd.en.html">More info here.</a></p>
<h2 id="yourfirstrealhtmlwebsite">Your first real HTML website</h2>
<p>Try replacing the code in your <code>.html</code> file now with real elements. Here's a quick cheatsheet of some of the most common elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, ‚Ä¶ all the way to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> are for heading text (1 is the most important, 6 is the least)</li>
<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is paragraph text</li>
<li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> adds emphasis</li>
<li><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is a line break (must be self-closing)</li>
<li><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> is a horizontal rule (must be self-closing)</li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is usually for nesting other elements inside</li>
<li><code>&lt;button&gt;</code> is, well, a button</li>
<li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code> is for links (stands for "anchor")</li>
<li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> is for an "unordered list", like a bulleted one</li>
<li><code>&lt;li&gt;</code> is a "list item" and should go specifically inside a <code>ul</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Try combining all of the concepts so far into your file. Come up with your own structure and content! For reference, here's what your editor might look like at this point:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/00/html-example.png" alt="A screenshot of my text editor, with a bunch of html elements written into a file." /></p>
<p>Now that we're using real HTML elements, you should see something different in your browser now. Your <code>h1</code> text should look very large and your <code>p</code> quite small in comparison. The <code>button</code> should look like, well, a button! And so on.</p>
<p>When I save that file and view it in my browser, it looks like this now:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/00/html-example-output.png" alt="The browser output of the example html." /></p>
<p>I mean, that's a pretty cool website, right?</p>
<h2 id="nbaboutspacingindentation">NB: About spacing &amp; indentation</h2>
<p>In some cases, specific spacing is required for things to work. But in a lot of cases, it's just personal preference. For example, these three snippets should all work and look the same in your browser:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;
blah blah text content&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;
  blah blah text content

&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>              &lt;h1&gt;
      blah blah text content
          &lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Programmers like to enforce strict indentation rules (always indent when you move into a child element, etc.) so their code is more legible. Your text editor can even <a href="text-editor-basics.html#savingyourfiles">automatically do that for you whenever you save your file</a>. for convenience.</p>
<p>That being said, remember that this is a stylistic choice, not a requirement! There's nothing about indentation, spacing, or formatting that makes someone fundamentally a <em>better</em> programmer.</p>

        Text Editor Basics
      </h1>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Prerequisites:</h4><ul id="prerequisites"><li><a href="./what-is-a-website.html">What is a Website?</a></li></ul>
      <p>As review, a "text editor" refers to an application on your computer that is specifically designed to help you write code. Since code is really just textual instructions for your computer, you end up just using it, quite literally, to <strong>edit text</strong> in files.</p>
<p>I'll be using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a> to demonstrate some of these basics, but the functionality should be quite similar in <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, and other options as well.</p>
<h2 id="openingfiles">Opening files</h2>
<p>The first step when using a text editor is usually to open some files. Just like a lot of other programs, you can go to File &gt; Open and click on the item you'd like to view.</p>
<p>More often than not when writing code, however, you want to be able to quickly view and edit many files in a short amount of time. In a typical web application project, you might have hundreds or even thousands of files! It would be pretty inconvenient to have to visit the Open File menu every single time.</p>
<p>To make things easier, you can open an entire folder in your text editor instead of a single file.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/02/text-editor-anatomy.png" alt="A screenshot of what a text editor looks like." /></p>
<p>To create a file inside the folder, now you can just ctrl+click (or right click) on the sidebar to get a quick action menu, and select "New File." This is also an easy way to rename, delete, or move your files and folders.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/02/text-editor-new-file.png" alt="Ctrl+click (or right-click) the sidebar to create, edit, or delete files and folders easily." /></p>
<p>Once you've created files (or if you open a folder with pre-existing files), you can just click on a filename in the sidebar to open it in the main Editing / Viewing area.</p>
<h2 id="namingyourfiles">Naming your files</h2>
<p>The "file extension" is the last part of your filename, from the final dot. So in <code>dog.html</code>, "html" is the extension, and in <code>super-dog.test.js</code>, "js" is the extension.</p>
<p>This is important to know because that's how you tell your computer which coding language you're using in that file (<code>.html</code> ending means the file is in HTML, and <code>.js</code> means it's in JavaScript). You can edit this extension at any point by simply renaming the file.</p>
<p>The rest of the filename is up to you. You'll notice that a lot of developers use some basic patterns like all lowercase with dashes (<code>happy-birthday-to-you.html</code>) or sometimes all caps with underscores (<code>SECRET_CODE.js</code>). These are really just stylistic choices now*. You can name files using emoji, spaces, any capitalization, unicode symbols - whatever you like!</p>
<p><em>*There are historical reasons - spaces in filenames causing errors - and logistical reasons - it can be confusing if you have the same filename but one is capitalized and one is not. But those are choices, not requirements.</em></p>
<h2 id="savingyourfiles">Saving your files</h2>
<p>As a programmer, my most commonly used keyboard shortcut has to be <code>command+S</code> for saving. I learned the hard way (not just once!) not to make a lot of changes without saving my work, so now I save nearly every line I edit.</p>
<p>In addition to using the <code>save</code> shortcut, a very useful tool when coding is auto-formatting. Navigate to your text editor's Preferences or Settings menu to find this option.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/02/format-on-save.png" alt="Enable &quot;Format on Save&quot; in your text editor settings." /></p>
<p>"Formatting" here refers to things like adjusting the indentation and spacing to make things look neater.</p>
<p>I like to enable "format on save" instead of "format on type" because it can feel a bit jarring when things are moving around as you type. This is entirely an optional tool, though.</p>
<p>If you have any trouble finding this setting for your text editor, search online for "format on save [your-text-editor's-name]" (ex. "format on save Atom") and you'll easily find steps to turn that on.</p>
