<h2 id="aboutthisproject">About this project</h2>
<p>When I was a complete beginner learning web development, I felt that a lot of resources also assumed some basic knowledge I just didn't have (and didn't even know how to search for). There were so many references to things I didn't understand, which left me feeling stuck and frustrated to the point of quitting many times.</p>
<p>Looking back, it's clearer to me why this was happening. Tutorials often completely gloss over fundamental information, whereas more abstract courses can feel detached from real-world application. Many blog posts don't differentiate fact and opinion. There's just an overwhelming amount of information available in general that it's hard to know where to start.</p>
<p>This project is an attempt at bridging that gap. It's a guide for regular people - who might use technology day-to-day but have no idea how it works - to understand and apply the foundations of web development. Here are the main principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to use everyday language to describe concepts &amp; terms</li>
<li>Only use technical terms once they've been sufficiently explained</li>
<li>Always try to differentiate facts vs. opinions and requirements vs. preferences.</li>
<li>Dig deep into details; don't omit things for convenience</li>
<li>Provide immediately applicable examples and project ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions or feedback about the content, or would just like to follow along with the progress, <a href="https://discord.gg/phpkY4NaY7">join my Discord server</a>. There's a channel called <code>#web-dev-000</code> specifically for this project.</p>
<p>I'd especially appreciate feedback about:</p>
<ul>
<li>sections that are confusing (or particularly clear)</li>
<li>information that seems to be missing or inaccurate</li>
<li>parts that are boring (or particularly interesting)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="abouttheauthor">About the author</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Christine! Friends also call me Cha. Today, I serve as an Engineering Manager at <a href="https://www.clubhouse.io">Clubhouse</a> after some years of being a full-time software engineer (specializing on the frontend).</p>
<p>I never intended on becoming a programmer. In 2015, I figured I'd be a more effective web designer if I actually understood how the things I was designing were built. So I started poking around online and teaching myself some basics.</p>
<p>About 9 months later, without any formal classes or certifications (and no college degree), I secured my first full-time role as a software engineer at Squarespace.</p>
<h2 id="aboutmyjourney">About my journey</h2>
<p>The main questions I usually get are 1) how to learn and 2) how to do it so quickly.</p>
<p>This project is my attempt at answering these. But first, we should recognize a lot of significant circumstantial privilege that even allowed me the opportunity:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Plenty of time.</strong> I had recently quit full-time work and was freelancing to make ends meet. My hours were flexible, and I had no dependents. Being young, healthy, and very motivated, I probably averaged 5+ hours a day, 7 days a week, of active learning during those 9 months. Especially in the last few months, I often started coding in the morning and was still typing on the train ride home at 3am.</li>
<li><strong>Enough financial resources.</strong> To maintain this intensity, I was only taking the minimum amount of freelance work. During the last three months, I received a $6k grant from the Recurse Center to support my growth. Between these income streams and my nearly-maxed credit card (plus no dependents, no large medical bills, etc.), I was able to afford not having full-time work.</li>
<li><strong>A strong support network.</strong> I've always had immense encouragement from my family and friends. Mental health is one of the greatest yet most under-appreciated privileges, and it's especially critical in uncertain times. I was also lucky enough to join the Recurse Center for 3 months, which provided me with an excellent community of peers.</li>
</ol>
<p>As much as specific learning methods and individual efforts can help, reality often has more to do with existing circumstances than anything else. Each journey is different; be compassionate with yourself.</p>
