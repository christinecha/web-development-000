      <h2 id="whatisstyling">What is styling?</h2>
<p>You could certainly build a perfectly functional and useful website just using plain HTML. But if you want to customize the look of it, you'll need to learn about styling.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: functional but drab/default vs functional &amp; looks good? doesn't have to be literal, something fun?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each HTML element in your <code>.html</code> file can have its own unique style.</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div&gt;Block 1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Block 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Block 3&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If that's all you write in your <code>.html</code> file, your browser will just show three plain lines of text.</p>
<p>But with custom styling, you could put "Block 1" into a blue rectangle with rounded corners and pink text inside. "Block 2" could be jumping up and down, flashing yellow and purple! "Block 3" could always be stuck at the top of the page no matter how much you scroll.</p>
<p>You can style an element's color, positioning, animation, shape, size, and so much more. There are <em>hundreds</em> of traits, called "properties", that you can customize! Just like how <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a specific element name in HTML, these properties belong to another language, called <code>CSS</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some very commonly used CSS properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>color</code> - the color of the text inside the element</li>
<li><code>background-color</code> - the background color of the element</li>
<li><code>font-size</code> - the size of the text inside the element</li>
<li><code>width</code> &amp; <code>height</code> - the width &amp; height of the element</li>
<li>… and so on!</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these CSS properties has particular rules on what you can set them to. For instance, <code>font-size</code> can take a value like <code>10px</code>, which would make your text 10 pixels tall. You'll encounter an error if you just set it to <code>10</code> though, because as a rule, <code>font-size</code> requires units.</p>
<p>Hundreds of properties - each with their own particular set of rules. Yeah, this is often the most intimidating part of styling.</p>
<p>But don't worry! Learning to code isn't about memorizing everything. In fact, one of the most important skills a programmer can have is being able to search for answers online effectively.</p>
<p>If you forgot how <code>font-size</code> works, for instance, you could search "font-size CSS" and get endless explanations. With common issues, you can likely even search your specific problem, ex. "font-size 10 not working css" and someone on the other side of the globe will have a blog post about it. The beauty of the web!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: Some ridiculously specific question (not web related even) and someone on the other side of the world answering it?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="okaybuthowdoyouaddthesepropertiestoanhtmlelement">Okay, but how do you add these properties to an HTML element?</h2>
<p>We previously learned about HTML attributes and how to use them to save information about a specific element. Like setting an image element's source:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img
  src="https://funnyfoto.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cat-saturday-30-photos-91_07_02_2018.jpg"
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>One of most useful attributes is called <code>style</code>. This is one of those "global" attributes - one that is available on every type of HTML element from.</p>
<p>Just like CSS properties, each HTML attribute has specific rules about what kind of values it will accept. The rule with the <code>style</code> attribute is that its value always has to be formatted as CSS code.</p>
<h2 id="letswritesomecss">Let's write some CSS!</h2>
<p>Now that we've gotten comfortable with how to write in the HTML language, it's time to learn another. In CSS, correct syntax looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">color: red;
background-color: blue;
</code></pre>
<p>For each property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property name comes first (always lowercase, never with spaces, dashed between words)</li>
<li>Then a colon (<code>:</code>)</li>
<li>Then the property value</li>
<li>Finally, a semicolon (<code>;</code>) to mark the end of the value</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nbsmallspacingformattingnotes">NB: Small spacing &amp; formatting notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The spaces are not required. Writing the same CSS as <code>color:red;background-color:blue;</code> is completely valid.</li>
<li>Semicolons are required between different properties. Since there's no property following <code>background-color</code>, you technically don't need one there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we just need to take that little chunk of CSS code and set that as the value to a <code>style</code> attribute on one of our HTML elements:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="color: red; background-color: pink;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: yellow;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font-size: 30px;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Try writing similarly styled HTML elements in your <code>.html</code> file. When you view your website (remember, save the file and then refresh your browser!), you should see different colors and font sizes! Hooray!</p>
<h2 id="nbdefaultstyles">NB: Default styles</h2>
<p>HTML elements come with some default styles. Remember how big the <code>h1</code> was in comparison to the <code>p</code> text, even before you added any <code>style</code> attributes? That's because your browser gives <code>h1</code> a default <code>font-size</code> style that is larger than the default of <code>p</code>. And <code>button</code> has a border by default. And so on.</p>
<p>You'll notice that depending on which browser you open up your .<code>html</code> file in, the default styling might also look slightly different. This is because, although the leading browsers have agreed on a lot of things, there are still areas where they diverge.</p>
<p>This is important to know for when your cousin, who still uses Internet Explorer, asks you why your website looks so different on their screen!</p>

      <p></p>
      
      <h2 id="whydoweneedtotalkaboutcolor">Why do we need to talk about color?</h2>
<p>In our previous example, we set the <code>color</code> property (which affects text color) to words like <code>red</code> or <code>blue</code>. There's a long list of these preset colors that browsers will accept. Some of my favorite are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>aliceblue</code></li>
<li><code>firebrick</code></li>
<li><code>papayawhip</code></li>
<li><code>oldlace</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>ILLUSTRATION: literal fun mixes with the ones up there? Or any of these work too: https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a joke. Try these colors out and see for yourself!</p>
<p>(Some developers at some point in time were given the power to make up color names, and that's what they came up with.)</p>
<p>Here you can find all 147 predefined color names, or "color keywords", available in CSS: https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords</p>
<p>But wait! Haven't I seen more than 147 colors on the internet? (Also, isn't it ridiculous to type "papayawhip" every time?)</p>
<h2 id="rgbredgreenbluecolor">RGB (Red, Green, Blue) Color</h2>
<p>Any color you see on your computer screen is produced by red, green, and blue lights shining out from it. This mix of color lights then blend together to make your brain think it's actually a single color!</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">a Wikipedia page how RGB works</a> and where it came from.</p>
<p>In CSS, the amount of each color light you want is measured from 0 to 255, 0 being none of that light and 255 being the most possible amount. So to specify the specific color you want to make, you have to define these amounts.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> red, <code>0</code> green, and <code>0</code> blue = <strong>black</strong> (no light at all)</li>
<li><code>255</code> red, <code>0</code> green, and <code>0</code> blue = <strong>bright red</strong> (only red light - and the max amount of it)</li>
<li><code>255</code> red, <code>255</code> green, and <code>0</code> blue = <strong>bright yellow</strong> (red + green light)</li>
<li><code>255</code> red, <code>255</code> green, and <code>255</code> blue = <strong>white</strong> (all colors at full blast)</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, to actually use these mini recipes in your code, you'll need the proper syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black: <code>rgb(0,0,0)</code></li>
<li>Bright Red: <code>rgb(255,0,0)</code></li>
<li>Bright Yellow: <code>rgb(255,255,0)</code></li>
<li>White: <code>rgb(255,255,255)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The format you need is <code>rgb</code>, then the color values in order (red, then green, then blue) in parentheses. The numbers must be separated by commas. As seen in some previous CSS, everything must be lowercase.</p>
<h2 id="applyingcolorvaluestostyles">Applying color values to styles</h2>
<p>Now that you know how to code a specific color value, you can use it in your CSS styles!</p>
<p>Previously we were using color shortcuts "red" and "pink":</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="color: red; background-color: pink;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now try putting in your own custom RGB colors!</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="color: rgb(200,120,0); background-color: rgb(90,20,30);"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Do you know what colors these combinations will make? Well, neither can I (besides some educated guesses). Don't worry about having to memorize these numbers or even being able to know what color they are at a glance. There are so many tools that will do this for you!</p>
<h2 id="hexcolors">Hex Colors</h2>
<p>You can also format RGB colors as "hexadecimal" numbers, often called "hex codes" or "hex colors". It's the same concept - three numbers for red, green, and blue amounts - just formatted differently:</p>
<pre><code>#ae13f4
</code></pre>
<p>That probably looks confusing. Let's break it down. The <code>#</code> at the beginning is a required prefix to indicate you're using a hex code. This will be the same for every color. Then a code of exactly 6 characters.[^1]</p>
<p>These 6 characters are actually 3 pairs; the first two represent the R (red) amount, the next two are for G (green), and finally the last two are for B (blue). Believe it or not, each of these pairs still just translates to a number from 0 to 25!</p>
<pre><code>Red amount:   ae = 174
Green amount: 13 = 19
Blue amount:  f4 = 244
</code></pre>
<p>So that means these should look exactly the same:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: rgb(174,19,244);"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: #ae13f4;"&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Confused? The reason you see letters and numbers is because we're counting in base 16.</p>
<p>Usually we count in base 10 using the numbers 0 - 9. In base 16, you need 16 digits instead of 10. Since those numbers don't exist in our day-to-day usage, we pull in letters: 0 - 9, then a - f. (More info: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)</p>
<pre><code>Hexadecimal (Base 16): 0 1 2 ... 8 9 a  b  c  d  e  f
"Normal" (Base 10):    0 1 2 ... 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
</code></pre>
<p>The highest possible number using only two digits is <code>ff</code>, which, not coincidentally, is the equivalent of <code>255</code> - sound familiar?</p>
<h2 id="alltogethernow">All together now!</h2>
<p>Now you've learned three different ways to format a color value in CSS. These three blocks should all look identical:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: black;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: rgb(0,0,0);"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And so should these:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div style="background-color: red;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0);"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="background-color: #ff0000;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You'll see all three types used very commonly, so it's important to be able to recognize and understand them all. In your own use, choose whatever feels more comfortable for each case.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
<p>[^1]: You might discover, by accident or otherwise, that a 3-character hex code (ex. <code>#fff</code>) also works. This format is sometimes used as a shorthand when all three (R, G, and B) hexadecimal numbers are doubles of the same character. Ex. <code>#f0a</code> actually denotes <code>#ff00aa</code>, <code>#b9c</code> is <code>#bb99cc</code>, etc.</p>
